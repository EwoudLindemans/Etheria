# Aurorhythmic Resonance Cycle (ARC)

In the realm of Etheria, time is measured not merely by the passage of days and nights, but by the ebb and flow of the magical energies that suffuse the world. This measurement is known as the "Magispan," and it has its roots in the very essence that binds the world together.

- Alignment with The Collapse:
The Magispan is counted in cycles that correspond to significant magical resonances leftover from The Collapse. Each cycle, known as a "ARC" represents a unit of time that resonates with the magical frequency of the event. The moment of The Collapse itself is designated as "0 ARC" marking the starting point of this unique time measurement.

- Magical Pulse Measurement:
Magispans are determined by tracking the rhythm of the magical pulses that emanate from the earth. These pulses are influenced by the world's living landscape and the way it responds to various events and energies. Each pulse cycle marks the completion of a single Magispan, making it a countable and observable unit.

- Fading Echoes:
In the aftermath of The Collapse, the magical energies were released in a symphony of resonance. As time passes, the echoes of this symphony gradually fade, causing the duration of each Magispan to subtly shift. This creates an ever-changing time measurement that's intricately linked to the world's magical nature.

- Seasonal Variations:
Just as the world's landscape and creatures respond to magical energies, the seasons themselves are influenced by the ARCs. Different spans might be associated with unique weather patterns, growth cycles, or even occurrences of magical phenomena. This adds an element of unpredictability to the passage of time.

- Ritualistic Observance:
The inhabitants of Etheria celebrate the transition of Magispans with elaborate rituals and ceremonies. These observances serve not only as a way to mark time but also as a means to connect with the world's living magic. Rituals might involve offerings to the land, the use of enchanted artifacts, or the chanting of ancient incantations.

- Nexus of Magic:
Every tenth ARC is considered a Nexus, a particularly potent period where the magical energies peak. During a Nexus, the world's magic is more accessible, enabling greater feats of spellcasting, communication with magical creatures, and the unlocking of hidden powers.

- Magic-Infused Calendars:
To keep track of Magispans, communities use magical calendars that resonate with the world's energy. These calendars might be enchanted stones that change color, intricate sculptures that emit harmonious tones, or even sentient creatures that emit pulses in sync with the ARCs.
