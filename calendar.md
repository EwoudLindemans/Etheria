# Aurorhythmic Resonance Cycle (ARC)

In the realm of Etheria, time is measured not merely by the passage of days and nights, but by the ebb and flow of the magical energies that suffuse the world. This measurement is known as the "ARC," and it has its roots in the very essence that binds the world together.

- Alignment with [The Collapse](/i/17):
The date is counted in cycles that correspond to significant magical resonances leftover from The Collapse. Each cycle, known as a "ARC" represents a unit of time that resonates with the magical frequency of the event. The moment of The Collapse itself is designated as "0 ARC" marking the starting point of this unique time measurement.

- Magical Pulse Measurement:
Cycles are determined by tracking the rhythm of the magical pulses that emanate from [The scales](/i/19). These pulses are influenced by the world's living landscape and the way it responds to various events and energies. Each reasonance cycle marks the completion of a single ARC, making it a countable and observable unit.

- Fading Echoes:
In the aftermath of The Collapse, the magical energies were released in a symphony of resonance. As time passes, the echoes of this symphony gradually fade, causing the duration of each ARC to subtly shift. This creates an ever-changing time measurement that's intricately linked to the world's magical nature.

- Seasonal Variations:
Just as the world's landscape and creatures respond to magical energies, the seasons themselves are influenced by the ARCs. Different spans might be associated with unique weather patterns, growth cycles, or even occurrences of magical phenomena. This adds an element of unpredictability to the passage of time.

- Ritualistic Observance:
The inhabitants of Etheria celebrate the transition of ARC's with elaborate rituals and ceremonies. These observances serve not only as a way to mark time but also as a means to connect with the world's living magic. Rituals might involve offerings to the land, the use of enchanted artifacts, or the chanting of ancient incantations.

- Nexus of Magic:
Every seventeenth Cycle is considered a Nexus, a particularly potent period where the magical energies peak. During a Nexus, the world's magic is more accessible, enabling greater feats of spellcasting, communication with magical creatures, and the unlocking of hidden powers.

- Magic-Infused Calendars:
To keep track of Cycle's, communities use magical calendars that resonate with the world's energy. These calendars might be enchanted stones that change color, intricate sculptures that emit harmonious tones, or even sentient creatures that emit pulses in sync with the ARCs.

- Relation to the Ornite Ring:
Details are still unknown but the arcs seem to have a relation to the ornite ring.

## Events

### Arc 0 - 16 - Nexus of Recreation
- [The Collapse](/i/17) and The Birth of Etheria (Arc 0):
The cataclysmic collision between the world and the mystical creature Irion resulted in the shattering of the planet into countless fragments. This event, known as The Collapse, marked the birth of the world of Etheria. The land broke apart, and magic infused the fragments with life.
### Arc 17 - 33 - Nexus of Recovery
- The Rising of Resonance (ARC 0 - 57):
The planet began to mend through the magical residue left by Irion. This gradual healing process saw the emergence of pockets of Resonance, where the land breathed with life. Mountains shifted, valleys undulated, and forests pulsed, as if the world itself were a living entity, resonating with newfound vitality.
### Arc 34 - 50 - Nexus of Manifestation
-  The first [Iridian](/i/44) manifestations occurred randomly, deep within uncharted land. A few singular, unknown travelers who were lost manifested, leaving only confusion and questions in its wake.
### Arc 51 - 67 - Nexus of Scale Sanctuaries
- First Public Witnessing of an [Iridian](/i/44) Manifestation (ARC 51):
A group of explorers stumbled upon a strange, massive scale. As it hummed with static, a harmonic sound filled the air, and for the first time, an Iridian was seen by many, its form coalescing from the energy surrounding it, leaving the witnesses in awe and fear.
- The Era of Scale Sanctuaries and Scale-Backed Architecture (ARC 58):
Survivors of The Collapse discovered the unique properties of concentrated magical scales. These scales emitted a soothing energy that repelled dangerous creatures. Settlements formed around these Scale Sanctuaries, using the immense scales as natural defenses against the post-collapse dangers.
This ARC was triggered by the digging of [Or Flatstone](/i/13)
### Arc 68 - 84 - Nexus of Arcane Infusion
- The Technological Renaissance (ARC 74):
The survivors' connection with magical scales evolved. They learned to harness latent magic within the scales to power devices. Scale Conduits emerged, infusing tools, lighting systems, and communication devices. This led to a technological renaissance, where "scale-driven" technologies facilitated Etheria's resurgence.
### Arc 85 - 101 - Nexus of Reformation
- The Council of Elders (ARC 86):
The scattered races of Etheria established an overarching peace, with each race controlling its territory. The Council of Elders emerged as wise mediators, maintaining harmony through their collective wisdom. They settled disputes, fostering unity throughout the ever-changing world.
### Arc 102 - 118 - Nexus of Discovery
- Forbidden Sparks and Hidden Wonders (ARC 103):
The magical essence of the scales remained a potent force. The forbidden attempts to penetrate the scales' magical barriers led to sparks of magic. Cities managed to stabilize these sparks, using them as power sources. Yet, deep within the ruins of Kin'Darei, an enigmatic cavity guarded secrets that none could escape. Unbeknownst to many, the forbidden interaction with the scales caused the early signs of [corruption]() to grow, laying the groundwork for the next era of decay.
### Arc 119 - 135 - Nexus of Sylph's Sanctuary
- The Scale Conduit Revelation (ARC 125):
A group of individuals discovered a way to harness magic directly from the scales using special tools called scalespeakers. These devices resonated with the scale's magic, emitting potent beams of energy. Yet, their usage proved perilous, often resulting in dire consequences. Yet, their usage proved perilous, resulting in dire consequences. As [corruption]() crept into the scales, the once-pure conduits began to distort the magic, turning it into dangerous and twisted energy.
- The Ragged Goons' Pursuit (ARC 131):
The emergence of a dangerous group, The Ragged Goons, threatened Etheria's delicate balance. Their sole purpose became the search for unprotected scales, exploiting them for personal gain. As these outlaws delved into forbidden magic, they sowed chaos, testing the world's equilibrium. With each scale they desecrated, they accelerated the [corruption](), twisting the scalesâ€™ magical properties for self-serving purposes, making the surrounding lands unstable and dangerous.
### Arc 136 - 152 - Nexus of Corruption
#### The Arc of Corruption is the defining moment in Etheria's timeline, where the once-bountiful scales and the lands around them become centers of corruption, consuming everything they touch.

Nexus of Corruption: Rise of the [Blighted Scales]()
As the [corruption]() spreads, the magical properties of the scales mutate, becoming twisted versions of their former selves. Their once-pure energies, which once nurtured life and prosperity, are now tainted by a malevolent force, warping the world around them.
