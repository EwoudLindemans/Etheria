# Aurorhythmic Resonance Cycle (ARC)

In the realm of Etheria, time is measured not merely by the passage of days and nights, but by the ebb and flow of the magical energies that suffuse the world. This measurement is known as the "Magispan," and it has its roots in the very essence that binds the world together.

- Alignment with [The Collapse](/event/the-collapse):
The date is counted in cycles that correspond to significant magical resonances leftover from The Collapse. Each cycle, known as a "ARC" represents a unit of time that resonates with the magical frequency of the event. The moment of The Collapse itself is designated as "0 ARC" marking the starting point of this unique time measurement.

- Magical Pulse Measurement:
ARC are determined by tracking the rhythm of the magical pulses that emanate from [The scales](/scale/the-scales). These pulses are influenced by the world's living landscape and the way it responds to various events and energies. Each reasonance cycle marks the completion of a single ARC, making it a countable and observable unit.

- Fading Echoes:
In the aftermath of The Collapse, the magical energies were released in a symphony of resonance. As time passes, the echoes of this symphony gradually fade, causing the duration of each ARC to subtly shift. This creates an ever-changing time measurement that's intricately linked to the world's magical nature.

- Seasonal Variations:
Just as the world's landscape and creatures respond to magical energies, the seasons themselves are influenced by the ARCs. Different spans might be associated with unique weather patterns, growth cycles, or even occurrences of magical phenomena. This adds an element of unpredictability to the passage of time.

- Ritualistic Observance:
The inhabitants of Etheria celebrate the transition of ARC's with elaborate rituals and ceremonies. These observances serve not only as a way to mark time but also as a means to connect with the world's living magic. Rituals might involve offerings to the land, the use of enchanted artifacts, or the chanting of ancient incantations.

- Nexus of Magic:
Every sixtheenth ARC is considered a Nexus, a particularly potent period where the magical energies peak. During a Nexus, the world's magic is more accessible, enabling greater feats of spellcasting, communication with magical creatures, and the unlocking of hidden powers.

- Magic-Infused Calendars:
To keep track of Magispans, communities use magical calendars that resonate with the world's energy. These calendars might be enchanted stones that change color, intricate sculptures that emit harmonious tones, or even sentient creatures that emit pulses in sync with the ARCs.


## Events

### Arc 0 - 16 - Nexus of Recreation
- [The Collapse](/event/the-collapse) and The Birth of Etheria (Arc 0):
The cataclysmic collision between the world and the mystical creature Irion resulted in the shattering of the planet into countless fragments. This event, known as The Collapse, marked the birth of the world of Etheria. The land broke apart, and magic infused the fragments with life.
### Arc 17 - 33 - Nexus of Recovery
- The Rising of Resonance (ARC 0 - 57):
The planet began to mend through the magical residue left by Irion. This gradual healing process saw the emergence of pockets of Resonance, where the land breathed with life. Mountains shifted, valleys undulated, and forests pulsed, as if the world itself were a living entity, resonating with newfound vitality.
### Arc 34 - 50 - Nexus of Celestial Veil
### Arc 51 - 67 - Nexus of Scale Sanctuaries
- The Era of Scale Sanctuaries and Scale-Backed Architecture (ARC 58):
Survivors of The Collapse discovered the unique properties of concentrated magical scales. These scales emitted a soothing energy that repelled dangerous creatures. Settlements formed around these Scale Sanctuaries, using the immense scales as natural defenses against the post-collapse dangers.
This ARC was triggered by the digging of [Or Flatstone](/settlement/city/or/or-flatstone)
### Arc 68 - 84 - Nexus of Arcane Infusion
- The Technological Renaissance (ARC 74):
The survivors' connection with magical scales evolved. They learned to harness latent magic within the scales to power devices. Scale Conduits emerged, infusing tools, lighting systems, and communication devices. This led to a technological renaissance, where "scale-driven" technologies facilitated Etheria's resurgence.
### Arc 85 - 101 - Nexus of Reformation
- The Council of Elders (ARC 86):
The scattered races of Etheria established an overarching peace, with each race controlling its territory. The Council of Elders emerged as wise mediators, maintaining harmony through their collective wisdom. They settled disputes, fostering unity throughout the ever-changing world.
### Arc 102 - 118 - Nexus of Discovery
- Forbidden Sparks and Hidden Wonders (ARC 103):
The magical essence of the scales remained a potent force. The forbidden attempts to penetrate the scales' magical barriers led to sparks of magic. Cities managed to stabilize these sparks, using them as power sources. Yet, deep within the ruins of Kin'Darei, an enigmatic cavity guarded secrets that none could escape.
### Arc 119 - 135 - Nexus of Sylph's Sanctuary
- The Scale Conduit Revelation (ARC 125):
A group of individuals discovered a way to harness magic directly from the scales using special tools called scalespeakers. These devices resonated with the scale's magic, emitting potent beams of energy. Yet, their usage proved perilous, often resulting in dire consequences.
- The Ragged Goons' Pursuit (ARC 131):
The emergence of a dangerous group, The Ragged Goons, threatened Etheria's delicate balance. Their sole purpose became the search for unprotected scales, exploiting them for personal gain. As these outlaws delved into forbidden magic, they sowed chaos, testing the world's equilibrium.
### Arc 136 - 152 - Nexus of Quixotic Reverie
- The Enigmatic Scales Reasonance (ARC 138-148):
The existence of Five Scales that pierced the surface intrigued the world. These colossal landmarks held immense power. Belief spread that more hidden scales lay buried beneath. The balance between knowledge and the unknown became a driving force in the ever-changing world of Etheria.
