# Mistveil Marshes

South of the crossroads-laden **[Triz Valley](/geography/settlement/city/triz-valley.md)**, the land surrenders into the **Mistveil Marshes**—a sprawling morass of grey water, stubborn reeds, and slow, sucking earth. The mist hangs heavy like a second sky, folding itself around the knees of the ancient trees, veiling everything in a shifting, uncertain gloom. Beneath this blanket of damp, the ground thrums faintly with the buried threads of [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md), leaking into the world from wounds cut by [the Dense](/geography/cosmology/plane-of-existance/the-dense.md).

The **[Mudshapers](/structure/society/profession/mudshaper.md)** dwell here, their art born not of high sorcery but of hard-won patience and bone-deep understanding of the marsh’s moods. They coax the heavy, mineral-rich clay into living structures—huts that rise squat and strong against the creeping damp, bridges that sway but never fall, pillars that groan under their own weight but never yield. Their craft is an alliance between will and material, a labor of hands and heart, whispered lessons passed mouth to ear over uncounted generations.

Beneath the bogs lurk the rare **Soulglass Orbs**, strange translucent relics whose hollow glow betrays no purpose save to unsettle the mind. Scholars from [Scholar’s Rift](/geography/settlement/enclave/scholars-rift/scholars-rift.md) covet these orbs, claiming they are prisons for echoes of lost realms, each resonating with memories dangerous to the unprepared. [Mudshapers](/structure/society/profession/mudshaper.md), however, see them as mistakes best left undisturbed, like old scars on the flesh of the world.

Travelers who stray too deep into Mistveil tell tales of being led astray by shifting lights and voices that mimic familiar companions. Some vanish into the mist without sound or struggle, their tracks devoured by the greedy mud. The [Mudshapers](/structure/society/profession/mudshaper.md) simply nod when asked, as if this is the natural order of things—because in the Marsh, nothing stands still except those who forget how to listen.

Living here are the [Ogres of Glutt’thar](/structure/society/ogres-of-glutt-thar.md)

## Summary
In the Mistveil Marshes, strength is not measured in blows or bloodshed, but in patience, humility, and hands strong enough to build but gentle enough to heal. The **[Ogres of Glutt’thar](/structure/society/ogres-of-glutt-thar.md)** embody this wisdom, their lives a slow, enduring testament to the truth that not all giants are monsters—and not all battles must be fought with fists.
