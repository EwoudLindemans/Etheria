Sorhadjin — The Desert That Remembers
-->

# Sorhadjin

Sorhadjin is a vast desert region in northern Iridia, known as the ancestral homeland of the Zorathi. Marked by its shifting dunes, sun-scorched mesas, and sacred silence, Sorhadjin is as much a spiritual landscape as it is a geographic one. The desert is revered by its native people as a living memory—a place where footsteps echo across generations and stories are carried on the wind.

## Geography

Sorhadjin occupies a broad, arid stretch of land between the Blooming Skein and the eastern coast of Iridia. Despite the harsh climate, the region sustains life through deep oases, underground cisterns, and resonant stone formations believed to hold heat and memory alike.

Landmarks include:
- **The Flameward Faces** — partially buried stone statues marking the ancient walkways of the Zorathi clans.
- **The Telinga Paths** — wind-worn ridges and narrow canyons etched with Sa’Harim glyphs, walked ritually by each Tor-Karrim.
- **Ka’torhul Basin** — a vast, hollowed saltflat where great gatherings are held beneath moonless skies.

## Culture and Significance

To the Zorathi, Sorhadjin is not simply a place of origin—it is a **sacred companion**, known in their tongue as *Sa’hadin*, “the One Who Holds Flame.” It is here that their philosophy of **Sa’Harim** (“The Steady Flame”) was first spoken, and here that each generation reaffirms the call to strength through compassion.

The **Tor-Karrim** clans journey across Sorhadjin in wide, resonant circuits, never claiming land but always honouring its presence. Each clan contributes to the oral tradition through stories, dances, and sand-glyph rituals etched at night and scattered by dawn.

## Outsider Relations

Sorhadjin is rarely understood by outsiders. Those who treat it as barren or conquerable are swiftly humbled by its expanse and the quiet refusal of the Zorathi to explain what needs no defence. However, those who travel with respect may encounter Zorathi guardians, and in rare cases, be marked with the **Sunbound Oath**—a lifelong honour of guidance and protection.
