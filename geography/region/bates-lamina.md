## Appearance and Structure

Batès Lamina is a **bright red Scale**, polished and smooth in texture, and unmistakable in appearance. Despite its modest size, it radiates a low-frequency hum that can be **felt rather than heard**. This hum has a **calming effect** and is a central part of the spiritual practice of those who live around it.

The Scale stands at the heart of a lake, with a **city built along the water’s edge**. The terrain is mostly **open fields**, and the settlement has **barely any defensive structures**. Despite this vulnerability, the city has never been under serious threat, in large part due to the respect it commands throughout Iridia.

## The City and Shrine

The city surrounding Batès Lamina is a spiritual centre for the **Followers of Irion**, a peaceful and religious people who believe the magical dragon-like being known as **Irion** communicates through the Scales.

At the city's heart lies a **shrine built directly above the Scale**, with a **central cavity** said to give direct access to the Scale’s resonance. The Followers believe that **Irion speaks through this cavity**, offering insight, clarity, and divine presence to those who are worthy or prepared.

The shrine is considered **the most important place in the world** by the Followers of Irion, and it is treated with reverence by visiting pilgrims.

## Pilgrimage and Tradition

People from all over Iridia journey to Batès Lamina to **pray for good fortune** and bring **offerings of wine and fruit** to the shrine. These rituals are believed to strengthen one’s bond with Irion and to help align the soul with the great resonant forces of the world.

The ambient hum of the Scale is also used in meditative practices, allowing seekers to sit in silence for hours or days, absorbing the rhythmic pulse of the Scale and seeking inner stillness.

## Politics and Neutrality

The **Followers of Irion maintain a strict non-political policy**, refusing alliances, endorsements, or involvement in worldly governance. This detachment has earned them a reputation as **neutral mediators**, and their city is recognised as **neutral ground**—a place where feuding groups may meet without fear of manipulation or violence.
