# The Unstable Grounds (Training Area / Magical Minefield)
A vast, open field riddled with **lingering magical effects** from centuries of reckless spellcasting.  
No one fully understands the terrain, but most scholars agree that it's *better not to ask too many questions*.  

- Gravity is *optional* in some places, resulting in students **floating away mid-lesson**.  
- **Time loops** occasionally cause the same duel to be fought *multiple times*, often leading to very confused combatants.  
- Every so often, an unsuspecting student **gets launched into the sky** for reasons that remain **unclear**.  

The Unstable Grounds are perfect for **learning, sparring, and scientific disasters**, provided one has **a solid life insurance policy**.
