# The Rift Gate
The **only** way in and out of The [Scholar’s Rift](/geography/settlement/enclave/scholars-rift/scholars-rift.md), this swirling **unstable portal** only opens for those deemed “worthy.”  

- Most scholars assume the Rift Gate selects people **based on magical aptitude**...  
- ...but then **Barty Dunderfield**—a man with **zero magical talent**—walked right through, so the theory is *under review*.  
- Some say the Rift itself **decides who enters**, though *why it allows certain people in remains unknown*.  

The Rift Gate is the **first and last test** for all who seek **knowledge, power, or just really bad life choices**.  

## The Rift Gate Paradox
The paradox was born when [Nokk](/being/character/nokk.md) embarked on one of his many reckless expeditions into [The Dense](/geography/cosmology/plane-of-existance/the-dense.md), an act that only the most foolhardy scholars dared attempt. Unlike others, however, he was not lost within its folds. Instead, he moved through it as though it bent around him, his body flickering between locations that no two observers could agree upon.

At the peak of his exploration, something went wrong—or perhaps, went exactly as it was meant to.

[Nokk](/being/character/nokk.md) attempted to harness the [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) of [The Dense](/geography/cosmology/plane-of-existance/the-dense.md) itself, but the reaction was far more violent than he anticipated. A massive arcane pulse rippled outward, merging two points of time into a single point. Reality itself seemed to buckle, and when the rift finally settled, scholars across [Etheria](/geography/cosmology/etheria.md) realized that something had changed. The Rift Gate—long believed to be an ancient construct—had been stabilized at that exact moment.

Yet historical records made it clear: The Rift Gate had already existed before [Nokk](/being/character/nokk.md)’s birth.

To complicate matters further, ancient texts discovered within The [Scholar’s Rift](/geography/settlement/enclave/scholars-rift/scholars-rift.md) describe a blue-skinned figure standing at the Gate’s creation—a figure resembling [Nokk](/being/character/nokk.md) in every way. Whether this is proof of time-looped causality, an artifact of the Rift’s own nature, or something beyond mortal comprehension remains unknown.

[Nokk](/being/character/nokk.md) himself has stopped trying to explain it. Instead, he accepts the paradox as an immutable truth—one of many mysteries he is determined to unravel.

## What Happens if the Rift Gate Rejects You?
If the **Rift Gate** rejects someone, it does so in a manner that is **deeply personal, highly inconvenient, and usually humiliating**. 

### The Immediate U-Turn
- The person walks *directly into the Rift Gate*…  
- …only to emerge *right back where they started*.  
- They try again. Same result.  
- It’s like a magical revolving door, except *meaner*.  

### The Dramatic Ejection
- The Gate pulses once. Then twice.  
- A loud **"NOPE!"** resonates from seemingly nowhere.  
- The person is launched **several feet into the air**, landing face-first in the dirt.  

### The Polite Denial
- The Gate *almost* lets them through. Almost.  
- A floating sign appears:  
  > *"We appreciate your enthusiasm, but unfortunately, your application has been denied at this time."*  
- A small, passive-aggressive **gust of wind** nudges them back.  

### The Cosmic Delay
- They step forward... but **nothing happens**.  
- They try again. Still nothing.  
- They stand there for hours. Days. Weeks.  
- Eventually, they leave out of **sheer exhaustion**.  
- (Some say they were *never rejected*, just *never explicitly accepted* either.)  

### The Bureaucratic Nightmare
- A glowing **form appears**, demanding **"Verification of Worthiness."**  
- The form is **300 pages long** and includes questions like:  
  - *"Describe your magical philosophy in exactly 7 words."*  
  - *"If you were a potion, what would you taste like?"*  
  - *"Have you ever been a frog? If yes, explain."*  
- No one has *ever* completed the form.  

### The Temporary Ban
- The Gate **accepts them… briefly.**  
- They get **one foot in**, then get *violently repelled* back into reality.  
- A faint voice whispers:  
  > *"Try again next ARC."*  
- They now have an **arcane migraine** and **existential dread** for a week.  

### The Barty Exception
- If questioned about *why* someone was rejected, **Barty Dunderfield** (who *somehow* got in) will shrug and say:  
  > *"Hey, don’t look at me. It let me in, so clearly, standards are weird."*

## Mysterious Rumors About Rejection
- Some believe the **Gate judges personality** rather than magical ability.  
- Others think the Rift simply enjoys **screwing with people**.  
- A few claim **persistent rejections** lead to *something worse*. No one knows what.  

All in all, being rejected by the Rift Gate is either a **mild inconvenience** or **a soul-crushing existential crisis**, depending on *how much you wanted in*.
