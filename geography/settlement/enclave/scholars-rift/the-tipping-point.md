# The Tipping Point (Tavern & Social Hub)
The only place in The [Scholar’s Rift](/geography/settlement/enclave/scholars-rift/scholars-rift.md) where [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) is *strongly discouraged* (mostly because of past incidents that resulted in singed furniture and at least one liquefied bartender).  
Run by the ever-patient and slightly terrifying **Maera Greaves**, The Tipping Point serves as a gathering spot for students, Resonants, and Scalespeakers alike.  

- The name is fitting—many students leave **tipping over**, whether from drink, exhaustion, or a poorly-timed spell.
- The drinks are strong, the food is questionably edible, and the debates about [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) are *louder than necessary*.  
- The walls are enchanted to *auto-repair* after fights, a necessity after the infamous **"Fireball Happy Hour"** incident.  

Despite being a neutral ground, The Tipping Point remains an essential location for stress relief, networking, and overhearing gossip that *probably* should have stayed secret.
