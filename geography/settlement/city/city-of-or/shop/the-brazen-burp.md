# The Brazen Burp  
*A Legendary Tavern in The [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md)*

![rusty_pluckers_with_miss_terry.png](/world/rusty_pluckers_with_miss_terry.png =500x)

Nestled along the cobbled edge of **Stonegut Row**, just beyond the [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md)'s residual warmth, stands **The Brazen Burp**—a famed tavern that has withstood riots, revolutions, and at least one minor **planar misalignment**. Revered by **miners, mages, and misfits alike**, it pulses with laughter, ale, and the kind of philosophy only possible after your third tankard.

## Ambience & Appearance  
Worn wooden beams cradle a low ceiling stained by time and smoke. The walls are cluttered with faded **Flatstone Family** campaign posters, rusted weapons, and **dubious portraits of former regulars**. A raised stage dominates the center-left, used for performances or last-minute brawls. A second-floor **rickety balcony**, known locally as the “Drunken Loft,” lets the bold drink dangerously close to the edge.

The entire structure leans slightly to the left—either due to decades of singing or a botched **[Density Calibrator](/geography/settlement/city/glimmering-ashenburrow/density-calibrator.md)** test nearby.

## Gundric "Gundy" Alebrow  
**Owner, barkeep, and quiet monarch of mischief**, Gundy runs the place with a memory sharper than a dwarven battleaxe. **Heavyset, bald, and ever-watchful**, he speaks rarely but carries an uncanny sense of timing. Many believe he once worked with the **[Council of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/council-of-or.md)**, but traded politics for pints.

## The Rusty Pluckers  
The tavern's infamous house band The [Rusty Pluckers](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-brazen-burp/rusty-pluckers.md), composed of **two half-orc brothers** and a **goblin fiddler** with a twitch. Their chaotic melodies have been known to **cause or quell fights**, depending on how in tune they are. Their rendition of *"Don't Trust a Troll with Your Teapot"* is banned in five neighboring inns.

## Notable Regulars  
- **[Miss Terry](/being/character/miss-terry.md)** – Tiefling bard, **heartbreaker and harmony-bringer**. Wields a lute and sarcasm with equal flair.  
- **Grimsa Ironfist** – Elder dwarf, **twice widowed**, drinks only **Heartfire Reserve** and can arm-wrestle trolls.  
- **Harg & Pibble** – Known for their **drunken debates** on the philosophical nature of doors, identity, and whether time itself is just a hiccup.  
- **The Quiet Lot** – Mysterious, silent youths who always show up on **Open Talent Nights**, clap politely, and vanish.

## Tavern Lore & Local Myths  

### The Founding  
Some claim the tavern sprang into existence when a drunken wizard tried to **conjure an ale mug that never empties**. Instead, the spell supposedly birthed a tavern that only closes when Gundy nods.

### The “Or” Theory  
Locals insist that **The [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md)** earned its name from the infamous bar debate closer: “Is it truth… **or**?”

### Dueling to Drinking  
Built on the foundation of an old **dueling hall**, the Burp allegedly turned its violence into **competitive drinking matches**, forging peace through ale (and concussions).

## Open Talent Night  
Held **every other moonrise**, these chaotic performances are hosted by [Miss Terry](/being/character/miss-terry.md), backed by the Pluckers. Tales abound of spontaneous fame, lifelong humiliation, and one **accidental summoning of a spectral chicken**.

**Most legendary night?** When Gundy entered Harg & Pibble without their consent. Their seated, slurred debate on "the opposite of victory" won them first place—and a barrel of **[Brazen Brew](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/consumable/brazen-brew.md)** they never remember claiming.

## The Brazen Brew  

### Origins & Ingredients
The infamous [Brazen Brew](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/consumable/brazen-brew.md) was first concocted in a moment of chaotic inspiration by a younger, wilder Bogrum the Booming during a particularly violent brawl. The drink’s origins lie in the legendary Battle of The Brazen Burp, where a night of chaos, fists, and flying chairs led to the accidental mixing of:

- Whiskey (for wisdom, ironically)
- Cider (for sweetness, deceptively)
- Gin (for madness, obviously)
- Stout beer (for fortitude, questionably)
- Animal blood (for reasons lost to history)

By the time the brawl ended, those still conscious raised their mugs in unity and discovered they had created a drink so potent it blurred the lines between friendship, bravery, and terrible decision-making.

### Effects  
- One mug: **Temporary courage and impaired logic**  
- Two mugs: **Compulsory toasts to imaginary friends**  
- Three mugs: **Spontaneous song and possible divine audience**

No one drinks a fourth. No one *remembers* drinking a fourth.

## Reputation  
Recognized by **[Tankard Trekkers](/structure/society/profession/tankard-trekkers.md)** as a **Legendary Pint Post**, the Brazen Burp is **sacred ground** for any adventurer who values a good drink, a strange tale, or both at once.

Wanderers from **[Triz Valley](/geography/settlement/city/triz-valley.md)**, **the [Glimmering Ashenburrow](/geography/settlement/city/glimmering-ashenburrow.md)**, and even a few **[Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md)** have visited—some to drink, others to hear the whispers said to **linger in the walls between sips.**

## Notes

**The Brazen Burp** remains a cornerstone of **Or’s** cultural identity, where laughter battles sorrow nightly, and no one questions why the walls occasionally hum in harmony with the [Rusty Pluckers](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-brazen-burp/rusty-pluckers.md).

Raise your tankard. Just maybe not a third time.
