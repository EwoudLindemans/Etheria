# The Red Palm Hall
*“The Palm is Open, the Vein Unbroken”*

## Overview
**The Red Palm Hall** is the primary centre of healing and divine care in the [City of Or](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or.md). Nestled within the central district of **Stonehollow**, this modest yet deeply respected hall is operated by the **Order of the Woven Vein**—a clerical order devoted to the restoration of body, mind, and dignity.

Known for their unmatched bedside manner and quiet discipline, the hall’s clerics are frequently the first—and sometimes last—resort for adventurers, miners, and misstepped alchemists alike. The hall provides healing both mundane and magical, though most patients remember the warm touch and softly spoken words more than the spells.

## Location and Layout
Tucked between an old chapel vault and a bathhouse wall, the Red Palm Hall is larger on the inside than it appears. The interior is clean and humming with faint choral [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), lined with smooth stone beds and lanterns shaded red to soothe the eyes.

At its centre stands a wide relief carving of an open palm, etched with threads that resemble veins, branches, or roads—depending on the viewer.

## The Order of the Woven Vein
The clerics who staff the hall follow no single [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md). Instead, they hold to a shared philosophy that all lives are **threads in a greater tapestry**, and that healing is a sacred act of re-weaving what has been torn. They do not proselytise. They rarely ask for names.

Most clerics wear simple robes embroidered with vein-like stitching in red and gold. Each is trained in both divine [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and herbcraft, and several are known to hold rare blessings specific to Or’s resonant environment.

## Leadership
The hall is led by **[Brother Ienor](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-red-palm-hall/brother-ienor.md)**, an ageing half-elf with a quiet voice, bright eyes, and a strong belief in second chances. Though many consider him gentle, those who’ve seen him banish curses or argue policy with Flatstone councillors know better.

> “We are not here to judge how you were hurt. We are here so that hurt no longer defines you.” — *Brother Ilenor*

## Reputation
The Red Palm Hall is respected across all districts and social classes. Miners and nobles alike trust its clerics. It is one of the few places in the city where even hardened criminals lower their voices and take off their boots.

The hall does not charge for healing, though donations are encouraged. On feast days, they host communal meals for the injured and lonely.

## Notable Treatments
- **The Rebinding Touch** – A ritual healing that closes wounds while knitting the soul around the scar.
- **The Breath of Ironroot** – An herbal poultice infused with divine [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md), used to stabilise miners with lung damage.
- **Veinwhispering** – A quiet ritual for those haunted by trauma, wherein a cleric listens without speaking and channels memory into a redstone bowl, then offers the patient the choice to keep or release it.
