## Overview

Brother Ienor is the serene and widely beloved elven healer who leads **[The Red Palm Hall](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-red-palm-hall.md)**, the sanctuary of the **Order of the Woven Vein** in the **[City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md)**. He has devoted his life to alleviating suffering—not through grandeur, but through quiet acts of grace. Despite his dignified age and divine aura, it is his tender presence that most remember. 

Many Orfolk joke that Ienor’s presence alone can slow a fever and that more than a few mild injuries have been suspiciously exaggerated just to be seen by him.

## Appearance

Brother Ienor is an **older elf**, though to most he appears simply **timeless**. His age shows not in wrinkles but in stillness, posture, and the long patience of someone who has seen centuries pass. His angular features are unmistakably elven—high cheekbones, elegant brow, long tapered ears—and every gesture he makes carries the grace of a slow, sacred rite.

His skin is a smooth, pale umber, lit with a subtle warmth in lamplight. His eyes are silver-grey, thoughtful and piercing, with the distant softness of memory. He wears simple robes of crimson and cream, always immaculate, with the sigil of the **Open Palm and Woven Vein** stitched at the breast. His long white-gold hair is often tied back with a plain cord.

Those who see him often say he looks like someone who stepped down from a stained-glass window—but who would stop to help you up after a fall without even brushing the dust from his knees.

## Personality

Ienor is gentle but firm, soothing but immovable. He listens with sacred attention, responds with measured truth, and speaks as if each word is a gift. He is slow to judge and quick to act when someone is in pain. Despite a reputation that borders on sainthood, he carries no arrogance—only a deep sadness for the pain he cannot heal.

He has a quiet sense of humour and treats his fame with mild amusement. When [Miss Terry](/being/character/miss-terry.md) wrote *"I Need A Healer"*, which lovingly teased his beauty and reputation, Ienor approved it with a soft smile, saying, *"If laughter heals, let them laugh."*

## The Vow

Brother Ienor has taken a **vow of celibacy**—not from disdain for love, but out of devotion to his purpose. He believes that attachment would divide his compassion, and he wishes to remain open to all who suffer. The vow is **personal, not doctrinal**, and while his warmth might seem romantic, it is given equally to beggars and barons.

His composure under flirtation has become the subject of many tales: it is said that no one has ever made him blush, and if anyone did, the city might erupt into celebratory chaos.

## Role at the Red Palm Hall

As the lead healer, Ienor oversees treatment, spiritual counselling, magical affliction diagnosis, and the training of new acolytes. The **Red Palm Hall**, nestled in the **Stonehollow** district, is a sanctuary of calm red light and flowing water, its architecture designed to feel like a place outside of time. Under his care, it has become one of the most trusted institutions in Or.

He is often seen late into the night, tending to patients others have given up on, whispering ancient elven prayers over the fevered and forgotten.

## Connection to Sylieth

When **[Miss Terry](/being/character/miss-terry.md)** discovered a Tiefling urchin named **[Sylieth](/being/character/sylieth.md)**, she brought them to the Hall instead of the authorities. Brother Ienor welcomed the child without question. He recognised a rare divine spark within them, despite their worship of **Ilmater**—a god unknown to [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md).

He supported [Sylieth](/being/character/sylieth.md)’s path, even when others viewed it as heretical or misguided. To Ienor, the shape of faith matters less than the healing it brings. He has remained a steady mentor in Sylieth’s life, guiding without controlling, and protecting without smothering.

## Cultural Presence

Brother Ienor’s legend is kept alive not by self-promotion, but by songs, sketches, and whispered admiration. The bard **[Miss Terry](/being/character/miss-terry.md)** wrote the song *“I Need A Healer”* about him, and although playful in tone, it captures the genuine reverence Orfolk have for him.

It is common to see small carvings of open palms placed near shrines and fountains throughout the city—tiny tributes in his name.

## Rumours & Misconceptions

- Some say he walked onto a battlefield and healed both sides until the war stopped.
- Others believe he weeps once a decade, and that single tear can cure any curse.
- A few claim he was once in love, long ago, and that his vow was made in mourning.

Brother Ienor has never confirmed or denied any of these tales. When asked directly, he only replies, *“There is always more pain than story. Let the story bring comfort.”*

## Quotes

- *“If pain is a wound, kindness is the bandage. If suffering is a river, compassion is the bridge.”*
- *“Let them laugh, if it eases their burden. Healing begins in many strange places.”*
- *“I do not serve a god of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md). I serve the ache in every breath, the wound in every soul. That is enough.”*
