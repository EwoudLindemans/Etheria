# The Stable Flask

## Overview
**The Stable Flask** is the most reputable potion laboratory in the [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md), known far and wide for its uncompromising standards, consistent results, and polite signage. Located just outside the fringes of [Gutterbrew Alley](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/gutterbrew-alley.md), it serves as a calm counterpoint to the more chaotic brewing establishments nearby.

While not the most revolutionary or exotic alchemical workshop in the city, it is widely respected as **the safest place to acquire potions that do exactly what they say they do**—and nothing more.

## Location
The Stable Flask occupies a modest, slate-roofed building with reinforced stone walls and windows that never rattle, even during minor magical flare-ups. It’s situated on a clean, well-maintained corner near the Gutterbrew border, clearly marked with a polished brass plaque and a sign that reads:  

> “No Chaos Past This Threshold.”

Inside, the shelves are meticulously labelled, the floors gleam, and the smell of dried mint and distillation herbs fills the air.

## Proprietor: Professor Marwa Krindlenut
The lab is owned and operated by **Professor Marwa Krindlenut**, a middle-aged gnome with a sharp bob of grey-streaked hair, a piercing gaze, and a memory for potion orders dating back decades.

Marwa is renowned for her insistence on **precision, quality, and predictable results**. She often tutors apprentices in the finer points of magical infusion and maintains a running feud (albeit an affectionate one) with [Drip](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-cauldron-lottery/drip.md), the infamous hobgoblin behind *[The Cauldron Lottery](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-cauldron-lottery.md)*.

> “If it fizzes unexpectedly, it didn’t come from my shelf.” — *Professor Krindlenut*

## Potion Types
The Stable Flask specialises in:

- **Healing Draughts** (certified non-addictive)
- **Focus Elixirs** for mages and scholars
- **Endurance Tonics** for miners and travellers
- **Minor [Resonance](/generated/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) Boosters** approved for use near sensitive magical equipment

Each potion comes with a full label, including usage instructions, known interactions, expiration dates, and brewing signatures.

## Reputation
Among merchants, adventurers, guards, and even council members, The Stable Flask is the go-to establishment for dependable alchemical goods. It is often recommended in medical referrals from [The Red Palm Hall](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-red-palm-hall.md), especially for patients in need of ongoing treatments.

Though it lacks the flair or intrigue of riskier shops, many citizens have come to see its **utter reliability** as something bordering on sacred.

## Comparison to Gutterbrew Alley
While [Gutterbrew Alley](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/gutterbrew-alley.md) is a district of *unrestrained* experimentation, The Stable Flask is often cited in contrast as a bastion of *measured intent*. Professor Krindlenut has been known to lend stabilising formulas to younger brewers—and to fine them if they spill ingredients near her threshold.

## Subtle Services
While the storefront is professional and clean, rumour has it that Professor Krindlenut occasionally **accepts private commissions** from respected clients, including discreet anti-toxins, clarity philtres, and detection brews. She will never confirm or deny this.
