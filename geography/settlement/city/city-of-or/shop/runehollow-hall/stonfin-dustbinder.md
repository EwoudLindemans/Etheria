# Stonfin Dustbinder

Stonfin Dustbinder is the cheerful and ever-curious halfling librarian who oversees **[Runehollow Hall](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/runehollow-hall.md)**, the ancient and revered library at the entrance of the Undercity of Or. A beloved fixture of the district of Stonehollow, Stonfin is known for his gentle wit, encyclopaedic recall, and the quiet joy he brings to the dusty work of knowledge preservation.

Though the dwarves originally built the hall in honour of [Or Flatstone](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/or-flatstone.md), Stonfin has become a natural guardian of its contents—respected by scholars, craftsmen, and council scribes alike. His presence bridges generations of lore with a humility and humour that keeps the great stone vault of knowledge feeling remarkably alive.

## Appearance

Stonfin is a warm-faced halfling with a slightly rounded build and the inviting, intelligent look of someone who listens more than he speaks. His hazel eyes are friendly and slightly squinted from a life full of smiling. A faint dimple graces his left cheek, while a subtle lipoma sits just below and forward of his right ear.

His hair—light brown and dark blonde—is medium in length, slightly tousled, and forms soft curls that frame his face. His faint stubble gives him a scholarly charm rather than ruggedness. He wears a high-collared cream shirt with the sleeves often rolled up for comfort, covered by an embroidered vest in shades of aubergine and weathered teal. The vest’s curling feather-and-scroll motif suggests both artistry and memory.

Ink stains on his fingers betray constant work with quills and ledgers, and a **raven-feather quill**—possibly sentimental—is always tucked behind one ear. He wears thin-framed, delicately enchanted glasses that glint with subtle arcane light, their hinges etched with miniature sigils of comprehension and clarity.

## Personality

Friendly, methodical, and mischievously sharp, Stonfin is the type to gently correct your mispronunciation of an obscure dwarven tome while offering you a cup of spice tea. He values memory, good penmanship, and jokes with hidden layers of linguistic irony.

Despite his quiet demeanour, he is far from timid. He has stood his ground before Council scribes, dwarven elders, and adventurers with equally confident charm—always armed with a politely cross-referenced footnote. His reputation for fair-mindedness and discretion has made him a trusted figure among those seeking lost lore or sensitive knowledge.

## Equipment

- **Enchanted Reading Glasses** – Stylish frames enchanted for clarity, memory recall, and possibly slow-motion ink-splatter protection.
- **Raven-Feather Quill** – Always tucked behind his ear; its origin and purpose are his own to tell.
- **Vest of Many Pockets** – Contains bookmarks, folded notes, pocket-sized glossaries, and the occasional emergency biscuit.

## Role in the City of Or

Though not a native dwarf, Stonfin is deeply woven into the intellectual life of the [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md). His stewardship of [Runehollow Hall](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/runehollow-hall.md) ensures the preservation of city charters, ancestral records, magical ledgers, and engineering manuscripts. He is often sought for guidance by apprentices, researchers, and curious council aides alike.

Some say he knows *exactly* where every volume is shelved—even the ones that were never officially recorded. Whether this is a halfling gift, a personal system, or enchantment is unknown, and Stonfin isn't telling.

## Known Facts (and Unknowns)

- **Backstory:** Stonfin's past remains unspoken—either by choice or design. Some believe he once travelled the Scales of [Etheria](/geography/cosmology/etheria.md); others think he was always meant to live among the shelves of Runehollow.
- **Rumours:** It is said that he once deciphered a cursed book simply by smelling its spine—and politely returned it to its shelf before sealing the aisle.
- **Favourites:** Known to favour candied ginger, quiet afternoons, and annotated margins.
