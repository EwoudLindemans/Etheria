# Drink: The Brazen Brew

**The Brazen Brew** is the most infamous and unpredictable drink in the [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md). A concoction of reckless inspiration, it was accidentally forged during the legendary **Battle of [The Brazen Burp](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-brazen-burp.md)**, when chaos and ale collided—literally. Its creation marked a moment so explosive that it birthed a drink, a song, and a warning, all in one.

No brew in The [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md) is as storied, feared, or celebrated. It is served rarely, spoken of often, and never drunk lightly.

## Ingredients
The original recipe is as legendary as the event that birthed it. Though many claim to have the exact mix, traditionalists stick to what Bogrum the Booming himself admits was an act of divine inebriation:

- **Whiskey** – *For wisdom, ironically*  
- **Cider** – *For sweetness, deceptively*  
- **Gin** – *For madness, obviously*  
- **Stout beer** – *For fortitude, questionably*  
- **Animal blood** – *For reasons lost to history*

All of it came together in a barrel knocked over during a tavern brawl, stirred by a falling chair and ignited (according to some) by a halfling's torch.

## Effects
The Brazen Brew’s effects vary by dose and constitution, but a loose consensus has been formed over the years:

- **One mug:** Temporary courage and impaired logic  
- **Two mugs:** Compulsory toasts to imaginary friends  
- **Three mugs:** Spontaneous song and possible divine attention  
- **Four mugs:** No one remembers drinking a fourth

## Origins
The **Battle of [The Brazen Burp](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-brazen-burp.md)** is still sung about to this day, thanks to Bogrum the Booming and his triumphant pub anthem. What began as a brawl over spilled pints, misunderstandings, and a very slippery stew turned into one of the most iconic bar fights in Or’s history.

At some point during the chaos, Bogrum—then a younger, brasher percussionist—grabbed what remained of the nearest drinks, poured them together, took a swig, and shouted, “**By the gods or worse, it works!**”

The drink that survived the brawl became legend.

## Modern Usage
Despite its origin, The Brazen Brew is still served (sparingly) at:

- **[The Brazen Burp](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-brazen-burp.md)**, where the original barrelhead still hangs on the wall  
- **[Election Festival](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/election-festival.md) trials**, unofficially, with great and terrible results  
- **Heroic commemorations**, often after something has exploded or nearly done so

It is said that only the foolish drink The Brazen Brew alone, and only the bold do it twice.

## Warnings
- Do not cast spells within one hour of consumption.  
- Do not propose marriage unless you're certain.  
- Do not attempt to climb anything.
