# The Guard of the City of Or  
*A tradition of watchful kindness beneath the glowing stone*

The Guard of the [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md) is the official civic force tasked with upholding the peace, ensuring safety, and maintaining the deep trust between Orfolk and their mountain. Though often simply called “the Guard,” their presence is as layered as the city they serve—ring by ring, gate by gate, voice by voice.

Unlike many militarised patrols in [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md), Or’s Guard is woven directly into the fabric of community life. Known for its humane enforcement, empathetic response, and layered ranks, the Guard is as much a cultural institution as a force of order.

## Structure and Division

The Guard is composed of interconnected posts and specialist teams, each designed to suit the demands of a city split between sunlit terraces and glowing underdeep. While leadership is officially overseen by the [Council of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/council-of-or.md), everyday operations are handled by veteran Watchwardens, many of whom have walked the same beats for decades.

### Known Divisions

- **Hearthring Post** – Focused on the surface-level outer city, including marketplaces, festivals, and public ceremonies. Renowned for conflict mediation and crowd navigation.

- **Runehollow Beat** – Patrolling the region from the [Stonehollow](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/stonehollow.md) gate to the ancient halls of knowledge. Guards here are often chosen for their literacy, calm temperament, and reverence for the city’s past.

- **Deepward Keepers** – Operating in the lower Undercity where forge smoke blurs light and the clang of metal never sleeps. These guards face dangers from smuggling to tunnel creatures.

- **Ashen Enclave Patrol** – A rare, rotating post for those trained in unpredictable navigation, magical logic puzzles, and gnomish customs. Required for operations near or within the [Glimmering Ashenburrow](/geography/settlement/city/glimmering-ashenburrow.md).

- **Outer Gate Guard** – Those stationed on the high roads and tundra watchpoints. These guards serve as first contact for travellers and threats alike.

## Rank Structure

- **Watchwarden** – Senior district commander with both strategic and public-facing duties.  
- **Shieldhand** – Seasoned mid-rank, often responsible for a patrol group or investigation.  
- **Guardling** – Junior officer or new recruit, usually paired with mentors.  
- **Veilkeeper** – Specialist role within the magical and arcane enforcement division.  
- **Guestwarden** – Temporary honorary title, granted to respected citizens in emergencies.

## Culture and Training

Guards are selected not only for strength or skill, but for their ability to navigate the complex needs of Or’s diverse populace. New recruits receive training in:

- Local law and dwarven custom  
- De-escalation and negotiation  
- Arcane field safety and [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) anomalies  
- Orinite philosophy and practical ethics

Many Guard members are born into multi-generational service families, though the city welcomes fresh blood from varied walks of life. Cross-cultural empathy and resilience are prized above bravado.

## Public Perception

The Guard is generally beloved in the [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md). Jokes, stories, and small tokens of appreciation are common—especially in Hearthring and [Stonehollow](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/stonehollow.md). Their authority is tempered by tradition, oversight, and visibility: many citizens know their local guards by name.

Criticism, when it arises, tends to centre around bureaucratic slowness or uneven representation in newer districts. However, internal correction is swift and reputations are taken seriously.

## Notable Members (Summarised)

- **Watchwarden [Berrun Dimmabrow](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/guard-of-or/berrun-dimmabrow.md)** – The friendly and widely respected head of Hearthring Post, Berrun is known for his even temper, clear authority, and longstanding ties to the community. He is often seen speaking with [Brother Ienor](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-red-palm-hall/brother-ienor.md) or enjoying a quiet pint near [The Brazen Burp](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-brazen-burp.md).

- **Guardling [Darik Stoneveil](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/guard-of-or/darik-stoneveil.md)** – A thoughtful, bookish young dwarf stationed on the Runehollow Beat. Darik shows promise beyond his rank and is known for his calm under pressure, keen observation, and love of Or's history.

## Rumours and Local Lore

- “Stonewatch is always listening”—A half-serious saying implying the Guard knows more than it shows.
- Some whisper that the **Oblique Concord** has hidden influence over certain divisions. No confirmed evidence exists.
- "Ashen Patrols never report the same way twice"—a joke among Guardlings about getting lost in the [Glimmering Ashenburrow](/geography/settlement/city/glimmering-ashenburrow.md).
