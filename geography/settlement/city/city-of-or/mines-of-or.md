# The Mines of Or

Nestled like a vast labyrinthine heart beneath the [Armour of Or](/geography/scale/armour-of-or.md), the Mines of Or pulse with life, danger, and legend. It was the fearless dwarf, [Or Flatstone](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/or-flatstone.md), who first dared to cleave into the [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)'s living stone after [The Collapse](/structure/chronological/event/the-collapse.md). What he unearthed was a bounty so wild and magical that it transformed the desolate tundras above into the bustling, ale-drenched [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md). Rich veins of rare metals, radiant jewels, and fragments of the scale�s own resonating [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) were pulled from the earth like the very soul of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) singing into dwarven hands.

But the Mines are not merely scars upon the stone; they are veins of story and strangeness. Deep beneath Stonehollow�s glowing arches, some tunnels hum with an ancient, rhythmic thrum�suspected by superstitious miners to be the beating heart of the Armour itself. Others, darker still, whisper secrets to those reckless enough to stray. Rumors swirl like coal smoke in the ale-halls: of ghostly drummers in the deep, of twisted beasts birthed from raw [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) pockets, and of chambers that rearrange themselves when left unwatched, as if the Mines dream when they sleep&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

Labor here is brutal but intoxicating. Generations of miners�Dwarves, Humans, and even (Half-)Orcs�have carved not just ore but entire neighborhoods into the bones of the world. Their stubborn persistence gave rise to strange wonders like The [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md), a living forge fueled by the Core Heat that bleeds from the [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)�s crystalline spine. Here, magical alloys are birthed, capable of absorbing ambient [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and growing stronger over time�a property envied and feared across [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md).

Amid the endless stone are hidden treasures and darker relics. It is whispered in the smoky alcoves of [Gutterbrew Alley](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/gutterbrew-alley.md) that somewhere in the oldest shafts lies a passage into the [Glimmering Ashenburrow](/geography/settlement/city/glimmering-ashenburrow.md), that improbable city between realities. Others claim that forgotten vaults hold relics of the first miners�things too dangerous or sacred to ever see sunlight again, including shards from failed [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) experiments that warp the very laws of nature when touched.

Today, the Mines of Or are a living paradox: both a source of unimaginable wealth and a tomb of countless ambitions. Adventurers still delve deep under the council�s trembling contracts, some seeking fortune, others drawn by the reckless need to tame the unyielding stone. Most return bearing a few baubles and a haunted look. Some never return at all. And a rare few return... changed, eyes glinting like the hidden veins they disturbed.

Those who know best�usually found passed out under a table at [The Brazen Burp](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-brazen-burp.md)�will tell you this: In the Mines of Or, it isn�t greed that gets you killed. It�s *hope*�that mad, beautiful hope that somewhere, just one more swing of the pickaxe will crack open not just gold, but legend itself.
