# Gorgrath the Brute
Gorgrath is a large, muscular orc. He has a scar running down the right side of his face, which is missing its eye and part of the ear. His right arm has been amputated at the elbow, and he walks with a limp. He was born in the Skein of Bones

As a Orcish slave owner. He was the leader of a slavers camp where many dwarves were forced to excavate stones that were used in the building of new towns following The Collapse. He lost his right arm and part of his face and was left for dead after a rebellion, led by Or Flatstone.

## Recovery and training
Not much is known about the events that followed the rebellion at the quarry. It is rumored that, ashamed of his defeat, Gorgrath retreated to the Mountains of Triz where he started training for his eventual revenge on Or Flatstone.

## Revenge, death and theft
Seven years after the rebellion at the quarry, Gorgrath sneaked into the Town of Or wearing an iron mask and a prostetic sword-arm. He single handedly defeated the 17 dwarves guarding Or Flatstone before dying at the hands of Or himself, laughing loudly, with a great axe sticking out of his forehead. After his death several dwarves went out, cut of the head and stole it.
