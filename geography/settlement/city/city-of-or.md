# The City of Or
Not long after [The Collapse](/structure/chronological/event/the-collapse.md), an opportunistic dwarf named [Or Flatstone](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/or-flatstone.md) gathered a band of miners and started digging and hewing beneath one of the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) what is now called The [Armour of Or](/geography/scale/armour-of-or.md). The [Mines of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/mines-of-or.md) provided magical scales, rare metals, jewels and riches beyond imagination and attracted many foreign workers. Besides other Dwarves, many Orcs and Humans found their way to the employ of the Flatstone Family.

## Harthrûn Metallurgy "The Dwarven Craft"
[Harthrûn Metallurgy](/structure/society/profession/harthrûn-metallurgy.md) or Heartscale Runemagic Metallurgy in full is a Dwarven craftsmanship that has always been renowned, but under the vast influence and [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) of The [Armour of Or](/geography/scale/armour-of-or.md) it has achieved unparalleled craftmanship. The Core Heat from the [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) allows dwarves to craft magical alloys that are imbued with elemental powers and arcane properties, beyond anything previously possible. The magical properties embedded in the alloys include fire resistance, earth manipulation, and the ability to channel arcane energies.

The Dwarven City of Or is the heart of this craftsmanship, where the geothermal heat and [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) from The [Armour of Or](/geography/scale/armour-of-or.md) powers vast forges and magical workshops. The heat enhances not only the strength of the materials but also the magical properties of the weapons, armour, and tools produced here. Items created in these forges have the ability to store magical energy, amplify the wearer’s powers, and protect against both physical and magical threats. These items are often considered to be living pieces of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), intricately tied to the Core Heat that sustains the very forges they are created in.

## Citizens of Or
Homes were built into the underground caves of Or where the mines were depleted of precious resources. Many elves and humans with an interest in the magical properties of the white [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) of Or have moved into the heart of the City of Or to provide their services to the locals and travelers. Besides jewels, the City of Or is known for its excellent selection of ales, brewed in the depths of the mines to appease the miners and attract visitors to the many taverns of Or. The outside of the city has attracted many farmers, providing the City of Or with a steady flow of food.

## Districts

The City of Or is a city of layered stone and shifting depth, with districts expanding both outward and inward from the original mines. Some are official, others informal—each with its own character, tone, and voice.

### Stonehollow
Immediately beyond the great gate into the mountains lies [Stonehollow](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/stonehollow.md)—a massive vaulted chamber that acts as the **interior city centre** of the Undercity. It is a hub for commerce, ritual, and movement deeper into the mountain.

The red-glowing crystal embedded in the vaulted ceiling of [Stonehollow](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/stonehollow.md)—formed from the exposed underside of the [Armour of Or](/geography/scale/armour-of-or.md)—is commonly referred to in Orfolk songs and poetry as “the Armour’s Red Moon.” This name captures the way its radiant beams filter through the Undercity like a second sun, casting angled shadows and suffusing the district with warm, magical twilight.

### Hearthring
The central and oldest surface district of Or, wrapped around the original mine gate. Hearthring is the heart of civic life and the stage for festivals, politics, music, and tavern chaos. It is home to the Stone Council Hall and [The Brazen Burp](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-brazen-burp.md).

### Coalwalk Row
A rugged residential and working-class district carved along the mountainside, known for its loud community life, local brews, and smithing culture. Proudly home to miners, crafters, and independent workers.

### The Spillway
A steep and chaotic corridor of trade, connecting surface routes and underground freight lines. [The Spillway](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/the-spillway.md) is where goods, scrolls, crates, and tempers move the fastest.

### Noteworthy Mentions
- **The [Glimmering Ashenburrow](/geography/settlement/city/glimmering-ashenburrow.md)**  
  A mysterious, space-warped city hidden between the halls of the City of Or. Mostly populated by gnomes, it’s said to exist *everywhere and nowhere* at once. Most Orfolk know of it, but few can say exactly how to get there.
  
- **[Gutterbrew Alley](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/gutterbrew-alley.md)**  
  An unclaimed and unregulated passage connecting [Coalwalk Row](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/coalwalk-row.md) and [The Spillway](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/the-spillway.md), filled with experimental brewers, rogue alchemists, and the occasional goblin vending machine. No one governs it, but everyone visits it eventually.

### Local Food and Brews

The Flatstone Family has invested heavily in the production of fine ales and ciders, brewed in the depths of the mines and enjoyed across the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md). These drinks are a source of local pride and a favourite topic in any tavern debate. They are brewed from locally harvested fruits, mushrooms, berries, and grains grown in or near the City of Or.

Some of the most iconic brews include:

- **The [Brazen Brew](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/consumable/brazen-brew.md)** – A legendary mix of whiskey, cider, gin, stout, and something wild. Created during a tavern brawl, it’s both a rite of passage and a warning. Three mugs and you're singing to gods. Four? No one remembers four.
- **[Sweetmoss Sip](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/consumable/sweetmoss-sip.md)** – A green, earthy ale with a vanishing sweet tone, born from a rare alliance between a gnome and an orc brewer. A symbol of harmony, now beloved across the city.
- **Light of Fargash** – A pale, golden elven-style ale brewed in honour of [Fargash Flatstone](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/fargash-flatstone.md), known for its smooth taste and diplomatic afterglow.
- **Deepdrip Black** – A bold mushroom stout with earthy tones and a hint of enchanted bitterness, brewed deep in the caverns near Hearthroot Garden.
- **Pickman’s Pour** – A crisp light ale made from local grains, often served in mining flasks and celebrated as the everyday drink of Orfolk.
- **Council’s Shame** – A tart, dark ale brewed from underground berries, famously named after a drunken council debate incident.
- **Flatstone Red** – A sharp, semi-sweet cider pressed from mountain-grown apples, traditionally served during festivals and council wins.

## Rulers of Or

Present day, the Great Dwarven Flatstone Family is the richest family on all of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md). The [Council of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/council-of-or.md) consists of **seventeen members**: **twelve permanent seats** held by the Flatstone family, and **five elected seats** filled every three years during the city's renowned [Election Festival](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/election-festival.md). While the Flatstones dominate the council numerically, elected representatives hold strong influence over civil matters. 

Crime is not tolerated and is punished harshly—but most citizens agree the council rules with a firm but fair hand.

## Rumours
- [Karath Flatstone](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/karath-flatstone.md), the current ruler of Or has not been seen for several months. High-ranking council members claim to still be in contact with him through letters bearing his official signature and seal. Gossip about this situation is spreading through the City of Or like wildfire, with rumours ranging from sickness to a coup by another dwarven family.
- Deep beneath the City of Or, miners have been disappearing. Some who have returned speak of drums in the stone and strange roars echoing through the tunnels. A few even whisper of ghosts or worse. The [Council of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/council-of-or.md) maintains that nothing is amiss, though adventurers have been seen entering the lower mines on council contracts—and not returning.
- Bartenders across Or whisper about [Asarazul](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/asarazul.md), a large, brilliant blue gem said to have been mined long ago from the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md) and now secretly held by the Flatstone family. Though the Council fiercely denies its existence, many believe it to be a relic of immense magical significance. According to legend, it passed through generations of dwarves and conflicts before arriving in the hands of [Or Flatstone](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/or-flatstone.md) himself—not long after founding the mines. Some even claim it still hums softly in a hidden vault near the [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md).

## Story
The truth is that [Karath Flatstone](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/karath-flatstone.md) has been kidnapped by a group of bandits and is being held for ransom. The council members are in contact with the kidnappers and are working on a plan to rescue him. However, they are worried that if news of the kidnapping gets out, it could destabilize the city.
