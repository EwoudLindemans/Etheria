However, as the players help Vorelith, they slowly discover the consequences of meddling with such a volatile power, and they must reckon with the personal and city-wide disaster that unfolds.

## Setting

### Mohinders
- **City of [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md)**: The campaign is set in Mohinders, a city divided by conflict over limited space and resources. Two factions—**The Council of Controlled Magical Appliance** and **The Veilbreakers**—are in an ongoing power struggle, each seeking to control magical resources, land, and influence.
- **The Spire**: A strange, egg-shaped tower built by Vorelith. It houses the central energy of [the Dense](/geography/cosmology/plane-of-existance/the-dense.md) and contains magical leylines. The Spire's structure is constantly shifting as its power grows, warping the area around it.

## Key NPCs

### Vorelith (The Villain)
- **Role**: Initially, a noble and charismatic mage. He seeks to use [the Dense](/geography/cosmology/plane-of-existance/the-dense.md) to resolve the conflict between the two factions by creating more physical space for the city.
- **Personality**: Driven, brilliant, compassionate, but increasingly obsessed with [the Dense](/geography/cosmology/plane-of-existance/the-dense.md)'s power.
- **Goal**: To create a new world order where resources are plentiful, and space is no longer a limiting factor. His obsession with [the Dense](/geography/cosmology/plane-of-existance/the-dense.md) leads him to make increasingly risky and dangerous decisions.

### The Denslings
- **Role**: Warped, shadowy creatures that inhabit [the Dense](/geography/cosmology/plane-of-existance/the-dense.md). At first, they are inconspicuous but grow in power as Vorelith manipulates the Dense.
- **Personality**: Initially silent and passive, they become more active and supportive of Vorelith as he helps them expand their reach into [Etheria](/geography/cosmology/etheria.md).
- **Goal**: The [Denslings](/being/species/denslings.md) are aligned with Vorelith as they share his goal of reshaping [Etheria](/geography/cosmology/etheria.md), but their true intentions might be more sinister—wanting to overrun and consume the world beyond [the Dense](/geography/cosmology/plane-of-existance/the-dense.md).

## Factions

### The Council of Controlled Magical Appliance
- **Overview**: A faction that believes in controlling magical resources and using [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) to benefit the people in a regulated manner. They oppose the Veilbreakers, who want to tear down the system.
- **Role**: Initially, they see Vorelith’s use of [the Dense](/geography/cosmology/plane-of-existance/the-dense.md) as a potential solution to the city’s conflict but are cautious about the unregulated [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) at play.

### The Veilbreakers
- **Overview**: A rebellious faction that seeks to overthrow the current system of controlled [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md). They argue that magic should be free, and anyone should be able to access it without restriction.
- **Role**: They are wary of Vorelith’s plan, seeing it as just another form of authoritarian control. They seek to sabotage his efforts.

## The Dense

### Description
- **What is [the Dense](/geography/cosmology/plane-of-existance/the-dense.md)?**  
[The Dense](/geography/cosmology/plane-of-existance/the-dense.md) is a treacherous, compressed realm where reality behaves in impossible ways. It’s a place between “here” and “there,” where space is distorted. Every foot outside of it is equal to 500 feet inside. The realm is dark, heavy, and full of strange flora and fauna, each more dangerous than the last.
- **Effects on the Campaign**  
   - Space is compressed and unpredictable.
   - People traveling through [the Dense](/geography/cosmology/plane-of-existance/the-dense.md) experience distorted distances, heavy gravity, and dangerous creatures.
   - The longer Vorelith works with [the Dense](/geography/cosmology/plane-of-existance/the-dense.md), the more it begins to invade the city of [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md), warping space and time around the city.

## The Denslings

### Description
- **What Are the [Denslings](/being/species/denslings.md)?**  
The [Denslings](/being/species/denslings.md) are the inhabitants of [the Dense](/geography/cosmology/plane-of-existance/the-dense.md), creatures born from the twisted fabric of reality within. They are dark, shadowy beings that exist in the periphery, unnoticed at first. However, their numbers and influence begin to grow as Vorelith continues manipulating the Dense for his own ends. 
- **Transformation**  
Initially, the [Denslings](/being/species/denslings.md) are passive, watching from the shadows. As Vorelith’s obsession deepens, they begin to view him as their benefactor and grow more powerful, ultimately becoming his servants.
- **Necromantic Army**  
Over time, the [Denslings](/being/species/denslings.md) begin to form a necromancer-like army, ready to help Vorelith take over [Etheria](/geography/cosmology/etheria.md), using the energy of [the Dense](/geography/cosmology/plane-of-existance/the-dense.md) to fuel his growing dominion.
