# Asara Plate
The Asara Plate plate sits in the ground at a 30 degree angle and broke in half. Underneath the overhang of this plate runs a route, with a side road that runs between the two halves. The roads are used by merchants and travelers, it has a blue almost ice like color that shines bright when the sun hits the surface.

There are several farms adjacent to the road runs between the two halves of the plate. These farms benefit from the magical properties of The Asara Plate. The crops grow at an accelerated rate, and the animals are unusually healthy. The people who live in the vicinity of The Asara Plate are some of the happiest in all of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md).

Because of the magical benefits, the local tax collectors have recently raised the taxes for the farmers in order to provide a more fair and balanced economy in the area. Though some of the farmers support this decision, there is a small and loud group that calls out the suspected corruption. This has led to tension and arguments among the villagers.

Despite the unrest, business is booming. Local craftsmen provide neighbouring towns with excellent woodwork and other crafts such as jewellery. The farms provide an abundance of food, and the people are content.

Life around The Asara Plate is good, but there is an undercurrent of tension that could boil over at any moment.
