# The Anchored Realm

**The Anchored**, short for The Anchored Realm, is the foundational plane of existence where all of Iridia unfold—a realm not hidden or distant, but *present*, immediate, and inevitable. It is not a higher realm, nor a deep one—it is the **baseline**, the place where resonance finds form, and where all magic, myth, and meaning draw their weight. Everything that exists resonates within the Anchored. It is the reason things *have shape*, the reason fire burns the same way twice, and the reason names hold power.

Here, the **law of Becoming** reigns. When something echoes—through word, ritual, emotion, or memory—it begins to tether itself to the Anchored. And when that resonance becomes strong enough, the Anchored responds. It *settles* the thing. It *finalizes* it. A creature long whispered into fear becomes a real monster. A prayer spoken by millions becomes a god. Even lies can become truth, if told loudly and often enough.

The Anchored is not always visible or accessible—it is simply always *there*. Beneath cities and starfields, behind spells and sensations. It is the invisible bedrock of being. When people say something “has become real,” they unknowingly describe a resonance that the Anchored has accepted and made whole.

To live in Iridia is to live inside the Anchored. To use magic, to tell stories, to carry belief—these are not acts of fancy, but acts of construction within this plane. Even the gods resonate here, walking the thin line between myth and anchor. Some fight it, others seek it, and a few, like Cirxa, carefully *evade* it—knowing that to anchor too fully is to lose all room for change.

Thus, the Anchored is not a place of endings—it is the place where all things **begin to truly exist**.
