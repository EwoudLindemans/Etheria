# The Fractured Keep (Xalónthyr)

> *“To walk from war into light is not a journey. It is a negotiation.” — Inscription on the border pillar between Askarath’s Blight and Vennalune’s Dawnreach*

The **Concordant Tread** is a divine plane formed entirely by the presence and interplay of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md)’s deities. It is not a single, unified realm—but a **stitched continent of god-territories**, each one an exact spatial [manifestation](/structure/chronological/event/manifestation.md) of a [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md)’s domain. These domains are not metaphors or symbols—they are *real*, material, and deeply territorial.

Here, gods do not merely reside. They **expand**, **contract**, and **border**.

### Structure

The plane is made up of **Domain-Spaces**, each fully material and utterly distinct in logic, physics, and danger. These regions form organically around a god once it becomes sufficiently anchored in [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) through its [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) association.

- A god of **light and clarity** (e.g., Vennalune) may govern the **Dawnreach**, a blinding, sun-drenched expanse where shadows are illegal and knowledge grows from the soil.
- A [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md) of **war and conquest** rules **Askarath’s Blight**, a scorched badland of eternal sieges, where terrain shifts based on acts of dominance.
- A domain of **[magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and mutation**, like the **Spindle Mire**, constantly rewrites its own laws, bubbling with raw arcane energy and unstable matter-storms.

Every domain has borders—but **borders are sacred**. To pass through another [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md)’s realm is a sign of treaty, coercion, or divine pressure. Which means…

### Travel = Theology in Motion

To move across Xalónthyr is to **enter** the influence of another god. For mortal agents, this means:

- Their spells may behave differently (a fire spell cast in Dawnreach burns golden truth instead of flame).
- Their minds may be altered temporarily by ambient domain logic.
- Simply existing in the wrong domain for too long might change their alignment, physiology, or even name.

For deities, it is worse: **They are constrained by the rules of the host domain**. A war god traveling through a peace [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md)’s domain may find its weapons dulling, its instincts silenced. That’s why they send avatars, proxies, and heralds—and rarely walk across borders uninvited.

### The Role of Scales

Each domain on the Tread is **anchored to a [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) in the mortal world**. When a [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md) is tethered to a Scale (e.g., Batès Lamina or the [Armour of Or](/geography/scale/armour-of-or.md)), their domain becomes stable and sustained within the Tread. If they die, fade, or are overthrown, the domain-space begins to **rot or mutate**, becoming unstable and difficult to cross.

Therefore, **transitions of divinity** must follow domain adjacency:

- If a war god dies and the [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) is to be taken over, **only a [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md) whose domains border War’s lands** in the Tread can inherit it.
- Otherwise, they must cross through other deities’ territory—an **act of divine diplomacy, invasion, or miracle**.

This system has led to divine alliances and betrayals over border rearrangements, and some deities (like The Unborn) have **floating or unstable domains**, accessible only by rare configurations.

### Known Domain-Spaces

- **Dawnreach** — Realm of radiant certainty and endless midday. Borders Knowledge, Order, and Renewal.
- **Askarath’s Blight** — The rust-colored warlands, where memory takes the shape of battlefields.
- **The Spindle Mire** — [Magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) incarnate. Everything mutates, even gravity. No borders remain stable.
- **Vel Hollow** — Domain of secrets, half-lit and fog-choked. Borders cannot be walked—only whispered through.
- **Sootgrove** — [Cult of Dy](/structure/society/factions/cult-of-dy.md)’s chaotic trialland. Roads shift by dice rolls; justice is spectral and erratic.
- **The Phrastic Isle** — Domain of language, lies, and performance. Everything is narrative. Travelers must speak their intentions in perfect verse or risk vanishing mid-sentence.

### Theoretical Implications

Scholars at [Scholar’s Rift](/geography/settlement/enclave/scholars-rift/scholars-rift.md) have argued that the **Tread is not eternal**—only the presence of the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) and divine [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) maintains its existence. Should [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md)’s Scales all be broken, the Tread may collapse, throwing the gods into disarray and unmooring their territories into a free-floating war of unstable realms.

Others speculate the **[Ragged Goons](/structure/society/factions/ragged-goons.md)** seek to discover Tread-passages to reach domains not yet mapped, attempting to introduce *foreign deities* into the Tread through forbidden domains—like the **Waxed Hollow** or the lost **Stone of Indulgence**.

**Rumors from the Borders:**

- A minor [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md) of decay is said to have found a way to *walk backwards through domains*, leaving no trace.
- [Cirxa](/being/character/cirxa.md) once traded a [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) fragment for the right to “blink” across three domains undetected—for reasons unknown.
- The Phrastic Isle once swallowed an entire mortal army for misusing a metaphor.
