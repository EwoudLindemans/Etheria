# The Rift Gate
The **only** way in and out of The Scholar’s Rift, this swirling **unstable portal** only opens for those deemed “worthy.”  

- Most scholars assume the Rift Gate selects people **based on magical aptitude**...  
- ...but then **Barty Dunderfield**—a man with **zero magical talent**—walked right through, so the theory is *under review*.  
- Some say the Rift itself **decides who enters**, though *why it allows certain people in remains unknown*.  

The Rift Gate is the **first and last test** for all who seek **knowledge, power, or just really bad life choices**.  


## What Happens if the Rift Gate Rejects You?
If the **Rift Gate** rejects someone, it does so in a manner that is **deeply personal, highly inconvenient, and usually humiliating**. 

### The Immediate U-Turn
- The person walks *directly into the Rift Gate*…  
- …only to emerge *right back where they started*.  
- They try again. Same result.  
- It’s like a magical revolving door, except *meaner*.  

### The Dramatic Ejection
- The Gate pulses once. Then twice.  
- A loud **"NOPE!"** resonates from seemingly nowhere.  
- The person is launched **several feet into the air**, landing face-first in the dirt.  

### The Polite Denial
- The Gate *almost* lets them through. Almost.  
- A floating sign appears:  
  > *"We appreciate your enthusiasm, but unfortunately, your application has been denied at this time."*  
- A small, passive-aggressive **gust of wind** nudges them back.  

### The Cosmic Delay
- They step forward... but **nothing happens**.  
- They try again. Still nothing.  
- They stand there for hours. Days. Weeks.  
- Eventually, they leave out of **sheer exhaustion**.  
- (Some say they were *never rejected*, just *never explicitly accepted* either.)  

### The Bureaucratic Nightmare
- A glowing **form appears**, demanding **"Verification of Worthiness."**  
- The form is **300 pages long** and includes questions like:  
  - *"Describe your magical philosophy in exactly 7 words."*  
  - *"If you were a potion, what would you taste like?"*  
  - *"Have you ever been a frog? If yes, explain."*  
- No one has *ever* completed the form.  

### The Temporary Ban
- The Gate **accepts them… briefly.**  
- They get **one foot in**, then get *violently repelled* back into reality.  
- A faint voice whispers:  
  > *"Try again next ARC."*  
- They now have an **arcane migraine** and **existential dread** for a week.  

### The Barty Exception
- If questioned about *why* someone was rejected, **Barty Dunderfield** (who *somehow* got in) will shrug and say:  
  > *"Hey, don’t look at me. It let me in, so clearly, standards are weird."*

## Mysterious Rumors About Rejection
- Some believe the **Gate judges personality** rather than magical ability.  
- Others think the Rift simply enjoys **screwing with people**.  
- A few claim **persistent rejections** lead to *something worse*. No one knows what.  

All in all, being rejected by the Rift Gate is either a **mild inconvenience** or **a soul-crushing existential crisis**, depending on *how much you wanted in*.
