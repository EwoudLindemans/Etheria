# Mohinders Spire

![eldeviers-shell.webp](/world/eldeviers-shell.webp =500x)

Mohinders Spire with its Veilsteel Tail is a city unlike any other, suspended upon the immense, opalescent form of Eldeviérs Shell. Its foundations are bound to the colossal structure by the Veilsteel Tail—an awe-inspiring, dragon-like framework of dark, iridescent metal, forged to honor the mythical being, Irion. This immense construct coils around the lower ridges of the Shell like the tail of a slumbering beast, its razor-edged plates etched with glowing sigils that hum with arcane energy. Massive iron rings and enchanted chains secure the city in place, preventing it from drifting into the unpredictable forces that swirl around the Shell’s glowing surface.

The city itself is a breathtaking fusion of ancient reverence and arcane ingenuity. Spires of dark stone and Veilsteel rise from the Tail’s structure, their forms reminiscent of Irion’s scales. Suspended walkways and platforms extend outward, anchored by energy fields, while floating districts hover in the skies beyond, shifting in slow, deliberate patterns. The Shell’s eerie green light bathes everything in an ethereal glow, casting shifting shadows over the winding streets and towering structures.

The Veilsteel Tail is more than just a foundation—it is a testament to Mohinders’ past, a sacred monument that channels the energies of the Shell. It serves as the city's lifeline, drawing power from the ancient structure beneath it, fueling the arcane portals and defensive wards that keep Mohinders secure. But recently, strange tremors have shaken the Tail’s metal plates, and the runes carved into its surface flicker unpredictably. Some believe that the Shell’s energies are shifting, while others fear a more unsettling possibility—that Irion’s spirit, bound within the Tail as legend claims, is stirring once more.

Meanwhile, the Shell’s glow, once revered for its restorative power, has taken on an unsettling aspect. The floating platforms above have begun to shift unpredictably, as if responding to something unseen. The scholars of the Keepers debate the truth—was the Shell always a sanctuary, or has it been a cocoon waiting to break open?

Airships hover cautiously beyond the city's edges, their pilots wary of the gravitational distortions that occasionally ripple through the sky. The portals flicker, unstable, as though the world itself is holding its breath. Mohinders remains, bound by chains and faith, clinging to the Shell’s enigmatic radiance.

## Council of Controlled Magical Appliance
At the heart of Mohinders’ governance stands the Council of Controlled Magical Appliance (CCMA)—a powerful assembly of arcane scholars, engineers, and enchanters tasked with stabilizing the immense raw magic that surges through the Shell and the Veilsteel Tail. The Council oversees the intricate network of conduits, runes, and siphoning devices that regulate the flow of energy, preventing dangerous surges that could destabilize the city. They maintain the arcane portals that link Mohinders to the lands below, ensuring that the power channeled from the Shell does not consume the city it sustains.
