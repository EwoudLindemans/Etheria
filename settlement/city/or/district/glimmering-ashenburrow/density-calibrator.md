# Density Calibrator

At the heart of the [Glimmering Ashenburrow](/i/58), the Density Calibrator is an unassuming yet vital device, created by [Poppy Handyleaf](/i/43), that ensures the stability of this hidden city within [The City of Or](/i/11). A delicate blend of magical engineering and arcane craftsmanship, the Density Calibrator regulates the shifting forces of [The Dense](/i/10), the compressed, unstable realm that the Ashenburrow inhabits. Without it, the Ashenburrow would either collapse in on itself or explode into The City of Or, threatening the fragile balance of reality.

## A Stabilizing Force
The Density Calibrator is a crucial element that keeps the Glimmering Ashenburrow from becoming too dense or stretching out of the compressed realms of The Dense into the broader world of The City of Or. The compressed space between Or's great halls and towering homes is a fragile pocket of reality, constantly at risk of distorting. The device works by subtly regulating the surrounding environment—modifying the density of the space and ensuring that everything, from buildings to inhabitants, remains anchored in place.

While it is not a loud or overtly noticeable device, its presence is felt throughout the city.

In the streets of the Ashenburrow, you’ll notice small, barely perceptible shifts as you walk. Buildings lean slightly, and paths twist in unexpected ways, but you never feel disoriented. The Calibrator subtly adjusts spatial tension, preventing anything from feeling oppressive or unnaturally stretched.

The inhabitants—mostly gnomes and other outcasts—go about their lives without much thought of the Calibrator. It keeps their world in balance, allowing their impossible city to thrive. Shops appear to fit in places where no shop should be, and homes somehow stretch deep beneath the ground or into the walls of neighboring buildings. This wouldn’t be possible without the Calibrator’s subtle regulation of the space.

The core of the device, housed deep in the heart of the Ashenburrow, pulses faintly with magical energy. It can be felt in the air, a slight hum as if the very stone and air are breathing together. While it’s not a constant force, when the air feels too dense or when gravity seems to shift unexpectedly, you’ll know the Calibrator is working, maintaining the integrity of this odd pocket city.

## Poppy's Creation
The Density Calibrator was created as a part of [Poppy Handyleaf's](/i/43) ongoing experiments with [The Dense](/i/10) a chaotic, compressed realm she became fascinated with. Through her research, Poppy discovered a way to manipulate the dense space around her, using a blend of arcane knowledge and mechanical ingenuity. What started as an experiment to understand the shifting forces of the realm led to the creation of the Calibrator—a device capable of stabilizing the compressed space Thus creating [Ashenburrow](/i/58) within the [City of Or](/i/11) .

As Poppy refined the device over time, its ability to regulate the space within the Ashenburrow grew more efficient, and it began to serve another, unintended purpose: secrecy. The Density Calibrator’s ability to subtly bend and shape space made it nearly impossible for anyone in The City of Or to detect the entrance to the Ashenburrow, keeping the city hidden within Or's walls.

In turn, the Calibrator has become invaluable to Silke Handyleaf, Poppy’s adoptive mother and the city's most renowned informant. Silke’s operations rely on the Ashenburrow’s secrecy, and thanks to the Density Calibrator, she can move through Or undetected, slipping between locations with ease. Silke has access to up-to-date information and can operate in full secrecy, as the Calibrator keeps the Ashenburrow safely hidden and stable while ensuring the city remains fully functional.
