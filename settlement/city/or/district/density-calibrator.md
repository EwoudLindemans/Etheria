# The Density Calibrator: A Stabilizing Force in The Glimmering Ashenburrow
At the heart of the [Glimmering Ashenburrow](/i/58), the Density Calibrator is an unassuming yet vital device, created by Poppy Handyleaf, that ensures the stability of this hidden city within a city. A delicate blend of magical engineering and arcane craftsmanship, the Density Calibrator regulates the shifting forces of [The Dense](/i/10), the compressed, unstable realm that the Ashenburrow inhabits. Without it, the Ashenburrow would either collapse in on itself or explode into The City of Or, threatening the fragile balance of reality.

The Density Calibrator is a crucial element that keeps the Glimmering Ashenburrow from becoming too dense or stretching out of the compressed realms of The Dense into the broader world of The City of Or. The compressed space between Or's great halls and towering homes is a fragile pocket of reality, constantly at risk of distorting. The device works by subtly regulating the surrounding environment—modifying the density of the space and ensuring that everything, from buildings to inhabitants, remains anchored in place.

While it is not a loud or overtly noticeable device, its presence is felt throughout the city.

In the streets of the Ashenburrow, you’ll notice small, barely perceptible shifts as you walk. Buildings lean slightly, and paths twist in unexpected ways, but you never feel disoriented. The Calibrator subtly adjusts spatial tension, preventing anything from feeling oppressive or unnaturally stretched.

The inhabitants—mostly gnomes and other outcasts—go about their lives without much thought of the Calibrator. It keeps their world in balance, allowing their impossible city to thrive. Shops appear to fit in places where no shop should be, and homes somehow stretch deep beneath the ground or into the walls of neighboring buildings. This wouldn’t be possible without the Calibrator’s subtle regulation of the space.

The core of the device, housed deep in the heart of the Ashenburrow, pulses faintly with magical energy. It can be felt in the air, a slight hum as if the very stone and air are breathing together. While it’s not a constant force, when the air feels too dense or when gravity seems to shift unexpectedly, you’ll know the Calibrator is working, maintaining the integrity of this odd pocket city.
