# Forging

## Scalewrought Veins 

Scalewrought Veins are deep-running ore deposits infused with ancient scale magic. These veins pulse with energy, their minerals altered by the lingering essence of powerful beings.  

From these veins, Scaleforged Ores are extracted—metals that grow in strength and potency over time. Rather than remaining static, these ores absorb ambient magic, binding deeper into their structure with each passing [ARC](/i/42).

The longer the ore remains unworked, the stronger its magical infusion becomes. A blade or armor forged too early is merely functional, but one crafted at its peak becomes legendary.
