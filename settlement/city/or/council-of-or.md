# The Council of Or
The Council of Or is a partially elected group the leaders of the [City of Or](/i/11), consiting mostly of members of the Great Dwarven [Flatstone family](#).

## Permanent members
Twelve members of the [Flatstone family](#) are permanently appointed to the council. The current members are:
- [Karath Flatstone](/i/26)
- Myyra Flatstone (Karaths wife)
- ...

## Elected members
Every three years the local population can elect five representatives to take part in the Council of Or. Although the elected council members (the voice of the people) have little to no influence on the mines of Or (which is a Flatstone family business), they have a serious say when it comes to the inner city workings of Or. This includes but is not limited to the cleaning up of Or, construction and maintenance works on public buildings (such as the town square or theatre) and trade restrictions.

## Election Festival
The elections of the council is a festive two week event that takes place every three years. During this time, the proposed council members-elect are subject to a series of trials (ranging from very serious to hilariously humiliating) that will help the population decide which of them best represents their interests.
Starting with a maximum of 200 possible council members at the beginning of the festival, after each trial event only the most popular participants continue to the next round, leaving contestants for the finale on Council Day.

### Trials of the Council
Although especially the later trials get more serious, most trials include a lot of local ale drinking. Some examples of council trials include the following:
- Naming of the most Flatstone family members
- Drinking of local ales and recognizing their name
- Debating the other contestants (while increasingly drunk)
- Picking up a stone that's been heated in the local forge (the last one to pick it up is out)
- Eating a live fish

The trials usually get more serious towards the end, with tasks such as: 

- Climbing to the top of Flatstone Mountain and back within 24 hours
- Solving difficult riddles 
- Running a gauntlet of angry citizens

### Incidents
During the Election Festivals, the local police are working shorter shifts so they too can join in with the festivities. The punishments for misbehaviour are temporarily loosened and often people that are in prison for less serious crimes are pardoned. Because many people are dressed up and drunk, incidents are known to happen.
Some notable incindents include:
- One time, a halfling traveler who did not participate in the elections was chosen to be a member on the council. He was notoriously missing for most of the three years in office because he chose to return to living with his family. (this proves that literally anyone has a chance to be on the Council of Or)
- During a particularly heavy debate about the trading of livestock, three council members-elect lost consciousness due to the consumption of too much alcohol. Strangely enough, one of them was chosen as the winner of the debate (despite missing more than half of it) and managed to make it to the council election finals.
- In one incident, an away team was discovered to have intruded on Mump's territory. The group were captured but tensions were eased when they started chanting "Long Live Mayor Mump" and saying that they should be forgiven as they clearly had too much to drink.
- One year, the elections resulted in a tie. This meant that four individuals would become Councilors including: Jolek Lokar (a clumsy Dwarven guard), Arr Ermcrimson (who had got drunk before the election even began), Ilek ir'Wynarn (the local ranger who tracked down said away team) and Sendar Elorfindar -  a local wizard who narrowly avoided disqualification due to his lack of physical prowess during the festival games).
