# The City of Or
Not long after [The Collapse](/i/17), an opportunistic dwarf named [Or Flatstone](/i/13) gathered a band of miners and started digging and hewing beneath the white scales of what is now called The Armour of Or. The [Mines of Or](/i/20) provided magical scales, rare metals, jewels and riches beyond imagination and attracted many foreign workers. Besides other Dwarves, many Orcs and Humans found their way to the employ of the [Flatstone Family](#).

## Harthrûn Metallurgy "The Dwarven Craft"
[Harthrûn Metallurgy](/i/64) or Heartscale Runemagic Metallurgy in full is a Dwarven craftsmanship that has always been renowned, but under the vast influence and resonance of [The Armor of Or](/i/12) it has achieved unparalleled craftmanship. The [Core Heat](/i/12) from the scale allows dwarves to craft magical alloys that are imbued with elemental powers and arcane properties, beyond anything previously possible. The magical properties embedded in the alloys include fire resistance, earth manipulation, and the ability to channel arcane energies.

The Dwarven City of Or is the heart of this craftsmanship, where the geothermal heat and resonance from [The Armor of Or](/i/12) powers vast forges and magical workshops. The heat enhances not only the strength of the materials but also the magical properties of the weapons, armor, and tools produced here. Items created in these forges have the ability to store magical energy, amplify the wearer’s powers, and protect against both physical and magical threats. These items are often considered to be living pieces of magic, intricately tied to the Core Heat that sustains the very forges they are created in.

## Citizens of Or
Homes were built into the underground caves of Or where the mines were depleted of precious resources. Many elves and humans with an interest in the magical properties of the white scales of Or have moved into the heart of the City of Or to provide their services to the locals and travelers. Besides jewels, the City of Or is known for its excellent selection of ales, brewed in the depths of the mines to appease the miners and attract visitors to the many taverns of Or. The outside of the city has attracted many farmers, providing the City of Or with a steady flow of food.

## Districts

[The Glimmering Ashenburrow](/i/58)

### Local food and brews
The Flatstone Family has invested heavily in the production of fine ales and ciders, which they sell to visitors who come through their town. They also have a small fruit orchard that produces various kinds of fruits, such as apples and apricots.

Some of the more notable brews include:
- An elven ale that is a light golden, almost white color
- A stout, brewed from the local mushrooms
- A light ale, brewed from the local grains
- A dark ale, brewed from the local berries
- A cider, brewed from the local apples

## Rulers of Or
Present day, the Great Dwarven [Flatstone Family](#) is the richest family on all of [Etheria](/i/15). [The Council of Or](/i/18) (consisting mostly of members of the Flatstone family) rules the city with a no-nonse attitude. Crime is not tollerated and severly punished. Some may say the family is harsh, but all agree that they are just.

## Rumours
- [Karath Flatstone](/i/26), the current ruler of Or has not been seen for several months. High rankning council members claim to still be in contact with him through letters bearing his official signature and seal. A gossip about this situation is spreading through the City of Or like wildfire, with rumours ranging from sickness to a coup by another dwarven family.
- Deep beneath the City of Or, miners have been disappearing. Some miners that have been very deep into the mines are spreading stories about the sound of drums and roars. Some even claim to have seen ghosts and other unnatural occurances. The official statement from the Council of Or is that nothing is the matter, although adventurers in the employ of the council have been seen entering the deepest mines and never return.
- According to local bartenders, the [Flatstone Family](#) possesses a bright blue gem that is made of the Scale of [Asara Plate](/i/22). Any inquiries about this rumour is denied vehemently, which (according to the local bartenders) is as good as a confirmation of this rumour.

## Story
The truth is that Karath Flatstone has been kidnapped by a group of bandits and is being held for ransom. The council members are in contact with the kidnappers and are working on a plan to rescue him. However, they are worried that if news of the kidnapping gets out, it could destabilize the city.
