# The Dwarven City of Or
Not long after [The Collapse](/the-collapse), an opportunistic dwarf named [Or Flatstone](/or-flatstone) gathered a band of miners and started digging and hewing beneath the white scales of what is now called The Armour of Or. The [Mines of Or](mines-of-or) provided magical scales, rare metals, jewels and riches beyond imagination and attracted many foreign workers. Besides other Dwarves, many Orcs and Humans found their way to the employ of the [Flatstone Family](/flatstone-dynasty).

## Citizens of Or
Homes were built into the underground caves of Or where the mines were depleted of precious resources. Many elves and humans with an interest in the magical properties of the white scales of Or have moved into the heart of the City of Or to provide their services to the locals and travelers. Besides jewels, the City of Or is known for its excellent selection of ales, brewed in the depths of the mines to appease the miners and attract visitors to the many taverns of Or. The outside of the city has attracted many farmers, providing the City of Or with a steady flow of food.

## Rulers of Or
Present day, the Great Dwarven [Flatstone Family](/flatstone-dynasty) is the richest family on all of [Etheria](/etheria). [The Council of Or](/council-of-or) (consisting mostly of members of the Flatstone family) rules the city with a no-nonse attitude. Crime is not tollerated and severly punished. Some may say the family is harsh, but all agree that they are just.

## Rumours
- [Karath Flatstone](/karath-flatstone), the current ruler of Or has not been seen for several months. High rankning council members claim to still be in contact with him through letters bearing his official signature and seal. A gossip about this situation is spreading through the City of Or like wildfire, with rumours ranging from sickness to a coup by another dwarven family.
- Deep beneath the City of Or, miners have been disappearing. Some miners that have been very deep into the mines are spreading stories about the sound of drums and roars. Some even claim to have seen ghosts and other unnatural occurances. The official statement from the Council of Or is that nothing is the matter, although adventurers in the employ of the council have been seen entering the deepest mines and never return.
- According to local bartenders, the [Flatstone Family](/flatstone-dynasty) possesses a bright blue gem that is made of the Scale of [Asara Plate](asara-plate). Any inquiries about this rumour is denied vehemently, which (according to the local bartenders) is as good as a confirmation of this rumour.
