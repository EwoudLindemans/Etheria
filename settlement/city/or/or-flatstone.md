# Or Flatstone
Born in poverty in a post-apocalyptic world (see: [The Collapse](/i/17)), Or Flatstone fled from the refugee camp at a young age. Working for food all over the continent, he used his intellectual and deceptive ways to gather a following amongst dwarvish prisoners in an Orc-led slavers camp. He started a rebellion that left [Gorgrath the Brute](/i/14) the Orcish Barbarian for dead and escaped with his own band of loyal dwarves.

## Expedition
Despite multiple warnings, Or and his band of dwarves were the first to enter the dangerous and magically unstable lands now known as [The Armour or Or](/i/12) where they started a mining expedition that eventually exposed the white scales. Making clever use of its magical properties and their skills with the excavating of gems, Or founded the legendary mines under the White Scales of Or and, eventually, the [City of Or](/i/11).
