# **World-Building: The Scholar’s Rift**

## **Name:** The Scholar’s Rift

The **Scholar’s Rift** is a magical hub, isolated from the non-magical world by a metaphysical barrier. Only those with magical ability can access it. It's a place of study, where knowledge, power, and resonance converge.

## **The Leader: Barty Dunderfield**

**Name:** Barty Dunderfield  
**Role:** Leader of the Scholar’s Rift  
**Personality:** Charismatic but slightly confused about magic. Barty believes in nurturing potential over raw power and ensures that magic is in the hands of the good. He’s not a mage but understands people, and that’s what makes him a respected leader.

## **Education System: "The Echoes Program"**

The Scholar’s Rift education system is built on the concept of **Echoes**—students learning from each other across generations. Older students learn from younger ones, creating a unique and collaborative environment.

## **Student Dynamics:**

### **Echoes of Flux**

Deryn Graff was always a bit of a wildcard. Fresh out of the First-tier, Deryn had an undeniable knack for pushing boundaries, especially when it came to experimenting with resonance. Her approach was unorthodox—often a little too unorthodox for her peers. Imagine one day, she shows up in class with a fireball that’s not quite a fireball but more of a "floating, slightly singed orb of potential." Thaxton Veridale, second-tier and a stickler for tradition, could barely contain his frustration. He had no patience for Deryn’s reckless methods. "This isn't a circus," he would mutter, but secretly, he admired her boldness, even if it irked him.

Serenna Forthwind, the third-tier Scalespeaker and the class’s voice of reason, had seen it all. She would watch as Deryn’s experiments caused Thaxton’s meticulous plans to unravel, but Serenna wouldn’t interfere. She was a philosopher at heart, someone who understood that chaos was often the prelude to great discoveries. "Let them learn," she’d say calmly, taking another sip of tea as a small explosion rattled the classroom. Despite her age, Serenna found herself intrigued by Deryn’s methods and amused by Thaxton’s stiff reactions. Both students had potential, and Serenna knew it would only take time before their paths crossed in a way that would change the world of resonance.

### **Echoes of Wavelength**

Miko "Whisper" Sullen was everything Bromar Keldar was not: quiet, introspective, and deeply attuned to the subtler frequencies of resonance. Miko could hear the hums of magic in the air, understand emotions just by the shifting energy around her. Bromar, on the other hand, was loud, boisterous, and could shake the very ground with his sonic resonance. One might think these two wouldn't get along—but their differences were what made them so perfect as a pair.

"Do you ever stop talking?" Miko asked once, her voice barely above a whisper, but it still managed to catch Bromar's attention.

Bromar, always the optimist, grinned. "Do you ever *start* talking?" he teased. But he genuinely appreciated Miko's uncanny ability to connect with the magic around them, even if it meant he had to tone it down a bit. Still, his idea of quiet study was a bit different from hers. He loved playing his flute loudly in the middle of the courtyard while Miko meditated in the corner, struggling to maintain focus. 

Enrica Vahn, a stern third-tier student, had the unenviable task of keeping them both on track. The older, more controlled Scalespeaker had little patience for their antics. "Focus," she would command with a look that could silence even the loudest student. Despite her intimidating presence, there was a strange warmth in her that Bromar respected, and Miko felt safe in her presence. Enrica wasn't just teaching them about resonance; she was teaching them how to find balance—something neither of them had mastered yet.

### **Echoes of Perception**

Kaelen Hightower had been born into nobility, and it showed in his demeanor. He walked into the classroom with an air of superiority, confident that his resonance would make him a natural leader among his peers. His skill in illusion resonance was undeniable—he could create convincing mirages, bend perceptions, and manipulate reality itself. But Kaelen was also arrogant, often more focused on showing off his abilities than honing his craft.

Nyra Bellrose, however, was the perfect foil to Kaelen’s ego. Calm, patient, and perceptive, Nyra could see through Kaelen’s illusions without much effort. "You’re hiding something," she once said, smiling as Kaelen’s grand illusion faltered for a brief moment.

"You *could* be better," she added, not unkindly, "if you weren’t so obsessed with looking perfect."

Kaelen, too proud to admit it, pushed harder, but Nyra’s steady wisdom forced him to rethink his approach. She was the type of person who got things done without making a fuss, and Kaelen would have to learn to respect that. 

Their third-tier mentor, Corwin Emberlash, enjoyed watching this dynamic play out. His methods were unorthodox and often cryptic, but Corwin had mastered the art of illusionary resonance like no one else. He saw the potential in both of them—Kaelen’s raw, untapped arrogance and Nyra’s quiet brilliance. The trick would be getting them to work together. "Illusions," Corwin would murmur as they practiced, "are like mirrors. They show you what you want to see—but sometimes, they show you something more."

## **Exams: Skillseeker to Scalespeaker**

The most anticipated event at **The Scholar's Rift** is the annual **Resonance Ascension Exams**. These exams determine who will make the coveted leap from **Skillseeker** (the rank of the most eager, green students) to **Scalespeaker** (the revered third-tier students). It’s a grueling process, and the odds aren’t in everyone’s favor.

**One in six** students will ascend to Scalespeaker status each ARC—*but don’t worry*, if you fail, you can try again the next ARC. It’s like a magical version of a job interview that never ends, except you’re mostly being judged on your ability to harness the magical *Resonance*—a mysterious force that even the scholars themselves still argue over.

The **Exams** are filled with tension, tests, and a lot of *“Well, at least I get another shot next ARC…”* moments. But every time a student ascends, it’s a joyous occasion—an event the entire Rift celebrates like it’s a magical graduation, complete with speeches, fireworks, and perhaps a few too many cups of *resonant* punch.

### **A Little Joke About the Exam Process:**

Bromar: "Do you think I’ll pass the exams this ARC?"

Miko: "Considering your last attempt, I'd say you have a better chance of summoning a sandwich out of thin air."

Bromar: "I did summon a sandwich once... but it was cursed."

Deryn: "At least it was something—last time I summoned a toad that wouldn’t stop singing opera."

Serenna: "I once summoned a small tornado. It was... productive, but mostly inconvenient."

Thaxton: "I don’t know why you all bother. The scales are just as likely to make you clean their shelves as grant you power."

Deryn: "Well, at least I’d be getting paid in knowledge and sandwiches... cursed or not."

---

**Jokes aside,** the **Ascension Exams** are no easy feat. Students are tested on everything from their practical resonance skills, their ability to adapt to chaotic magic, and their overall growth in understanding. Every ARC, more than half of the candidates will not pass. But every ARC, the students who do ascend bring their own unique brand of magic to the Scholar's Rift, further pushing the boundaries of the Resonance.

In the end, even if you fail, it’s all part of the journey. After all, this is the Scholar’s Rift, where magic is alive and always changing, and there's always next ARC to try again.

### **How to Succeed in the Exams?**

1. **Don’t Panic.** Stressing out only makes the resonance more chaotic. And chaotic magic never *looks* good in front of the judges.
2. **Harness Your Inner Chaos.** The best Scalespeakers don’t control resonance—they *work with it*. If you try to force it, it’ll turn into something else entirely. Probably a puddle. Or a really large bird.
3. **Patience is Key.** You won’t pass the exam in a day (unless you're very lucky). A slow, steady approach is often the most reliable. Or, if you're Deryn, an overly-ambitious approach that may or may not result in a very tiny explosion.
4. **The Waiting Game.** After you finish the exam, you’ll wait. And wait. And maybe play some cards. It’s a tradition.

---

As the exams draw closer each ARC, the entire Scholar’s Rift seems to hum with excitement and anxiety. Only a handful will rise to become Scalespeakers—but no matter the outcome, every student learns more, grows stronger, and prepares for next ARC’s shot at the title.
