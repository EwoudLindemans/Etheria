# The Mountains of Triz
A mountain range near the city of [Triz Valley](/triz-valley). The mountains of Triz contains a labyrinth of tunnels. Known to be the home of several goblin tribes, trolls and other mountain dwelling creatures.

## Tunnels
There are many tunnels inside the mountains of Triz, and without a guide or a keen sense of direction, one is certain to get lost. These tunnels possibly formed by lava flows. It is believed that the mountains of Triz are volcanic in nature, although there are no known occurences of any volcanic activity in the area.
In the city of Triz, there are many goblins that offer their services as a guide. It is recommended to arrange for passage through official channels as some budget guides, though cheap, are known to cheat their customers by leading them into one of the many goblin made traps where they are robbed, killed and eaten (not necessarily in that order).

## Goblin Tribes
There are many goblin tribes and villages in the Mountains of Triz, ranging from friendly to hostile. Some of the more notable are:

### Gurdalk's Gang
A nomadic tribe, famous for their deathly traps.

## The [Passage of Or](/passage-of-or)
Dwarves from the [City of Or](/city-of-or) have been working on creating a safe passage through the Mountains of Triz to [Triz Valley](/triz-valley) for many years. Work on the tunnels has been slow in recent years.

## Notable events
- [Or Flatstone](/or-flatstone) and his band are amongst the first to have found a passage through the Mountains of Triz.
- [Gorgrath the Brute](/gorgrath-the-brute) is believed to have spent seven years in the tunnels of the Mountains of Triz preparing for his revenge on [Or Flatstone](/or-flatstone).
