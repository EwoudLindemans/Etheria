# The Dense
The Dense is a place that is crammed between here and there. (compressed space). All travel through the lands of Etheria will pass the dense at one point or another. In this place dangerous denselings reside. [insert] In fact due to its compression everything feels almost twice as heavy. It is also home to many different kinds of plants and fungi, some of which are poisonous.

The wildlife is more than happy to eat anything that moves. Thus save passage is not known to exist. The dense is a place of danger and death. It is not a place to be taken lightly. It is important to be careful when travelling through this area as eating or touching the wrong thing could be deadly.

If you do find yourself in the dense, the best advice is to move quietly and carefully, and hope that whatever is out there doesn't notice you. The dense is also the primary home of the Etherials. While they can be found in other parts of the world, the dense is where they are most commonly seen.
