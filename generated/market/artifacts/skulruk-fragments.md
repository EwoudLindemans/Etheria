# Skulruk Fragments

## Shards of a Fallen Titan

Skulruk Fragments are remnants of the colossal Skulruk, a titan whose very bones formed the foundations of the now-ruined kingdom of Aethelgard. These fragments, imbued with residual titan energy, are highly sought after by artificers, mages, and those seeking to harness immense power. They vary wildly in size and potency, but all carry a whisper of Skulruk’s ancient strength.

**Types & Properties:**

*   **Minor Shard (Common):** Roughly fist-sized, dull grey. Grants +1 to Strength checks.  Sell for 50 gp.
*   **Resonant Shard (Uncommon):** Palm-sized, faintly pulsing with a pale blue light. Can be used to empower a single enchantment spell, increasing its duration by one level. Sell for 350 gp.
*   **Crystalline Shard (Rare):** Shaped like a jagged crystal, radiating a low hum. Provides advantage on saving throws against being knocked prone. Sell for 1500 gp.
*   **Heartstone Fragment (Very Rare):** A large, roughly heart-shaped piece, intensely warm to the touch. Can be used in a ritual to grant temporary access to a creature’s innate resilience, offering advantage on Constitution saving throws for 1d4 rounds.  Sell for 5000 gp.
*   **Nexus Shard (Legendary):** The largest fragments, glowing with an inner light.  These possess unique properties based on their location on the original titan and the memories absorbed by the titan.  Each one is unique and unpredictable in its power.  Sell for 10,000+ gp – value dependent on discovered properties.

**Crafting & Usage:**

*   **Artificers:** Commonly use Skulruk Fragments to reinforce armor and weapons, granting them resistance to specific damage types or enhancing their durability.
*   **Mages:**  Can channel the fragments’ energy to enhance spells, particularly those involving earth manipulation, elemental resistance, or physical augmentation.
*   **Alchemists:** Use pulverized fragments to create powerful potions, though this process is highly volatile and requires precise handling.

**Risks & Concerns:**

*   **Titan Echoes:** Some fragments retain fragmented memories and emotions from Skulruk’s existence. Handling them for extended periods can induce unsettling visions or surges of raw power.  (Requires a Wisdom Saving Throw DC 15 for prolonged use – failure results in disadvantage on next ability check)
*   **Unstable Energy:**  Improperly handled, the titan energy can erupt, causing minor tremors or unpredictable magical effects.
*   **Titan's Curse:**  Rumors persist that those who amass too many fragments risk attracting the attention of lingering spirits tied to Skulruk, potentially suffering curses or being manipulated by forces beyond their understanding.
