# Resonance Crystals

## What are They?

[Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Crystals are rare geological formations found in areas touched by wild [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) or near powerful planar rifts. They hum with raw magical energy and exhibit unusual properties that are highly sought after by sorcerers, artificers, and collectors alike. Each crystal resonates with a specific elemental force, though sometimes a chaotic mix of energies can be found.  The size, clarity, and intensity of the resonance directly impact the crystal's value and potential uses.

## Types & Properties

*   **Fire [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Crystals:** Emit a warm glow and generate a palpable heat. Highly sought for enchanting weapons and creating heat-based magical devices. (Value: 150-500 gp)
*   **Water [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Crystals:** Contain swirling blue and green hues. Excellent for healing [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and powering water-based constructs. (Value: 200-600 gp)
*   **Earth [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Crystals:** Solid and dense, often featuring inclusions of various minerals. Strong resonance for defensive enchantments and fortification spells. (Value: 100-400 gp)
*   **Air [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Crystals:** Light and airy, seemingly weightless. Used in transportation [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), levitation devices, and improving communication spells. (Value: 180-450 gp)
*   **Wild [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Crystals (Chaotic):** Irregularly shaped and colored, these crystals possess a mix of elemental energies. Dangerous to handle, but can unlock unique magical effects if properly harnessed. (Value: Varies greatly, 300+ gp - Extremely Rare)
*   **Void [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Crystals (Extremely Rare):** Black, obsidian-like crystals that absorb ambient magical energy. Believed to weaken planar boundaries and are highly prized by those seeking forbidden knowledge. (Value: 1000+ gp - Extremely Dangerous)

## Uses

*   **Spellcasting Focus:** Amplifies a sorcerer or warlock's spells, potentially granting bonus damage or increased range.
*   **Artificer Components:** Key ingredient in creating magical artifacts and enchanted items. Specific [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) types are required for certain effects.
*   **Magical Research:** Used by scholars and mages to study the nature of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and the planes beyond.
*   **Planar Travel:** Rare Void [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Crystals are sometimes used (with extreme caution) to create temporary rifts to other planes.
*   **[Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Tuning:** Skilled artisans can “tune” crystals to enhance or suppress certain elemental properties.

## Acquisition

*   **Mining:** Found in magical hotspots, often requiring specialized tools and protective gear. Dangerous due to unpredictable magical surges.

## Dangers

*   **[Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Feedback:** Improper handling can result in a painful and potentially dangerous magical backlash.
*   **Elemental Imbalance:** Prolonged exposure to a single type of [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Crystal can subtly alter a person's magical abilities, creating dependencies or weaknesses.
*   **Attracting Unwanted Attention:**  Possessing a large quantity of [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Crystals can attract the attention of powerful entities, creatures, or organizations seeking to exploit their power.
