### Biography

Alora Stonehand is a renowned Gnomish artificer, celebrated for her expertise in runestone technology and the creation of semi-autonomous constructs powered by magically-infused stones. Born and raised within the secretive Grimstone Gnomish Holds, Alora displayed an unparalleled aptitude for mechanical engineering and runic inscription from a young age.  Traditional Gnomish engineering focused on practical, utilitarian devices, but Alora was captivated by the potential of animating stone and imbuing it with purpose.  

Initially dismissed as fanciful by the elder engineers, Alora relentlessly pursued her research, tirelessly experimenting with different runic configurations and focusing on the synergistic relationship between physical machinery and magical energy.  Her breakthrough came with the discovery of a method to stabilize and channel raw earth energy through specially prepared runestones, creating a power source capable of sustaining complex mechanical functions.

This achievement led to the creation of her signature invention: the
