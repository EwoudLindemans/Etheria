**Abilities:**
* **Living [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md):** The Resonance Shard is a fragment of a larger, city-wide resonance field. It is intrinsically linked to the city and cannot stray more than 200 feet from its immediate area (typically within a specific district). Attempting to move it further causes the shard to rapidly dissipate and reform at a location closer to the district it originated from.

**Actions:**
* **Resonant Pulse (Recharge 5-6):** The shard emits a focused pulse of resonant energy. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of the shard’s next turn.

**Description:**
[Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Shards are crystallized fragments of the city’s underlying resonance field, often appearing as shifting, irregular masses of translucent stone. They pulse with a faint inner light, occasionally emitting subtle humming sounds. These shards are [manifestations](/structure/chronological/event/manifestation.md) of the city’s inherent memory and emotions, solidified into physical form. While not inherently malevolent, they react defensively to disruptions in the resonant field and can be unpredictable.  They’re often found near sites of significant historical events, ancient runes, or areas where strong emotions have lingered.

**Origin & Lore:**
It's believed that [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Shards are created when the city's resonant field experiences a sudden and traumatic shift, such as a magical explosion, a catastrophic event, or a period of intense emotional turmoil. The shards retain echoes of these events and act as a warning of instability, or a physical memory of a past disruption.

Some scholars believe that [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Shards can be ‘harmonized’ with skilled rune-crafters or resonators, allowing the harnessing of resonant energy for specific purposes—such as powering wards, enchanting items, or sensing disturbances in the city’s magical infrastructure. However, tampering with these fragments is highly dangerous and can trigger unpredictable releases of resonant energy.
