# The Circle of Shifting Realms

## An Interdimensional Research & Containment Circle

The Circle of Shifting Realms (CSR) is a highly secretive and specialized Mage Circle dedicated to the study, containment, and mitigation of interdimensional anomalies, tears in reality, and the incursion of entities from other planes of existence.

### Origins & History

The CSR was founded approximately 73 years ago, following a catastrophic incident involving a poorly-executed summoning ritual in the *Veridian Academy of Arcane Arts*. The resulting rift unleashed several creatures from the Plane of Whispers, requiring a rapid response force to stabilize the situation.  Recognizing the potential for further catastrophic breaches, a coalition of experienced mages formed the Circle, drawing members from diverse magical traditions.

### Core Principles & Practices

*   **Containment First:** Prioritizes the stabilization and containment of interdimensional breaches and entities over immediate eradication. This stems from a philosophy that forcing beings back from where they came is preferable to prolonged conflicts with potentially devastating consequences.
*   **Rigorous Research:** The Circle maintains an extensive library and experimental facilities focused on understanding the laws governing interdimensional travel, entity biology, and the nature of different planes.
*   **Adaptive [Magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md):**  Members specialize in a wide array of magic, particularly focused on protective wards, planar binding, and dimensional manipulation. They must be adaptable to the unpredictable nature of their work.
*   **Strict Secrecy:** The Circle operates with utmost discretion, concealing its existence from the wider magical community and the public. Information regarding its activities is classified at the highest level.

### Structure & Ranks

The Circle is structured in a hierarchical system:

*   **Initiates:** Recent recruits undergoing rigorous training and assigned to support roles.
*   **Wardens:** Core members tasked with field operations, anomaly response, and containment efforts.
*   **Cartographers:** Scholars and researchers responsible for mapping known dimensional anomalies and studying interplanar phenomena.
*   **Archons:** The governing body of the Circle, comprised of the most experienced and respected members.  The current Archon is **Lysandra Fellspar**, a master planar mage.

### Notable Members

*   **Lysandra Fellspar (Archon):** A renowned planar mage and expert in dimensional binding. Known for her calm demeanor and methodical approach.
*   **Kaelen Shadowwalker:** A skilled shadowmancer specializing in tracking and containing extradimensional entities.
*   **Sorina Azurewind:** A powerful geomancer who creates temporary planar barriers and stabilizes fluctuating realities.

### Base of Operations

The Circle maintains its primary base in a hidden location known as **Aetherium Hold**, a complex of magically shielded structures built within the **Scholars’ Rift**.  Aetherium Hold is situated near **[The Unstable Grounds](/geography/settlement/enclave/scholars-rift/the-unstable-grounds.md)**, making it ideally positioned for responding to planar incursions.

### Known Allies and Enemies

*   **Allies:** Occasionally collaborates with the **Veridian Academy of Arcane Arts** for research and training purposes, though relations are strained due to the Circle’s origin. 
*   **Enemies:**  Constantly facing threats from entities attempting to breach into the material plane. Also maintains a wary distance from the Cult of the Evervoid, believing them to be actively trying to widen dimensional rifts.
