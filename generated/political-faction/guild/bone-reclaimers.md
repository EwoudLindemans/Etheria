# The Bone Reclaimers

## A Guild of Necromantic Salvagers

The Bone Reclaimers are a secretive and pragmatic guild operating primarily within the blighted remains of the [Skein of Bones](/geography/region/skein-of-bones.md) and the fringes of the [Mistveil Marshes](/geography/region/mistveil-marshes.md).  Unlike the overtly aggressive [Ashenfang](/structure/society/clan/ashenfang.md), they are not driven by conquest or the subjugation of spirits.  Instead, they are driven by profit, a deep (if morbid) understanding of necromantic engineering, and a peculiar brand of morbid craftsmanship.

## Origin and Structure

The Bone Reclaimers emerged from the chaotic aftermath of the [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)'s fall and the subsequent sundering of the [Skein of Bones](/geography/region/skein-of-bones.md). Early members were scavengers, drawn to the colossal graveyard for salvageable materials. Over time, they evolved from simple reclaimers to specialized engineers and artisans, developing techniques for safely extracting bone, spirit-thread, and residual necromantic energy from the landscape.

The guild is structured as a loose confederation of Workshops, each specializing in a particular aspect of bone reclamation and crafting. A Council of Masters, elected from each Workshop, oversees the guild’s overall operations, mediates disputes, and sets ethical guidelines (which are often bent to suit individual Workshop interests).

## Goals and Motivations

*   **Salvage and Refinement:** Their primary goal is to efficiently and safely recover usable materials from the blighted landscape. This includes fossilized bones of all sizes, remnants of ancient necromantic constructs, and spirit-thread harvested with specialized filtration systems.
*   **Artisanal Crafting:** Bone Reclaimers are renowned for their unique crafts – intricate bone carvings, spirit-infused instruments, and remarkably durable armor and tools constructed from treated bone. These products are highly sought after, both for their unique aesthetics and their practical benefits.
*   **Technological Advancement:** They actively research new methods for bone processing, spirit manipulation, and necromantic engineering. They view knowledge as a valuable commodity, often trading information with universities, independent researchers, and even competing guilds.
*   **Neutrality (for Profit):** The Bone Reclaimers generally maintain a position of neutrality in the broader political landscape. They are willing to trade with anyone who can pay their prices, regardless of their allegiances. This has earned them both resentment and respect.

## Methods and Practices

*   **Controlled Excavation:** Unlike the destructive methods of the [Ashenfang](/structure/society/clan/ashenfang.md), Bone Reclaimers utilize carefully planned and controlled excavation techniques, minimizing disturbance to the surrounding environment and preserving valuable resources.
*   **Spirit Filtration:** They’re pioneers in spirit-thread filtration, allowing them to harvest this valuable resource without attracting the wrath of powerful spirits. Their filtering devices are complex and require skilled technicians.
*   **Bone Tempering & Infusion:** They have perfected techniques for treating bone, making it incredibly durable and resistant to damage.  They also infuse bone with residual necromantic energy to create powerful artifacts.
*   **Independent Contracts:** Workshops frequently take on independent contracts to clear specific areas of necromantic residue, recover specific artifacts, or create custom bone constructs for wealthy patrons.

## Relations with Other Factions

*   **[Ashenfang](/structure/society/clan/ashenfang.md):** A tense rivalry exists. The Bone Reclaimers view the Ashenfang as reckless and wasteful, while the Ashenfang dismiss the Reclaimers as timid and inefficient. Competition for resources is a constant source of friction.
*   **[Tuskbreakers](/structure/society/profession/tuskbreaker.md):**  A wary respect.  The Reclaimers appreciate the Tuskbreakers' knowledge of ancestral spirits and rituals, but question their dedication to tradition over progress.
*   **[Verdant Claws]( No link currently defined):** Generally avoided. The Verdant Claws view the Bone Reclaimers' activities as an affront to the natural order and actively seek to disrupt their operations.
*   **[Ogres of Glutt'thar](/structure/society/ogres-of-glutt-thar.md):**  A precarious alliance based on mutual need. The Ogres value the Reclaimers’ ability to clear areas infested with wandering spirits, while the Reclaimers rely on the Ogres for protection against more hostile creatures.

## Current Concerns

*   **Resource Scarcity:** The constant reclamation efforts have begun to deplete the easily accessible resources within the [Skein of Bones](/geography/region/skein-of-bones.md), forcing the Reclaimers to venture into more dangerous and unexplored areas.
*   **Increased Security Risk:**  The presence of more aggressive factions, like the [Ashenfang](/structure/society/clan/ashenfang.md), has increased the risk of conflict and sabotage.
*   **Ethical Debates:** The expanding use of necromantic technology has sparked internal debates about the ethical implications of their work.

## Notable Figures

*   **Master Elara Vane:** Current Head of the Council of Masters, a brilliant engineer and advocate for sustainable reclamation practices.
*   **Workshop Foreman Torvin Stonehand:** A gruff but skilled artisan known for his intricate bone carvings and bone-infused tools.
