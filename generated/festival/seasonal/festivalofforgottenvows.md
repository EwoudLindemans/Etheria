# Festival of Forgotten Vows

## A Time for Remembrance and Reckoning

The Festival of Forgotten Vows is a somber yet crucial event held annually during the waning days of the harvest season. It falls just weeks before the first frost, a period traditionally associated with reflection and introspection in many cultures. However, this festival carries a unique weight, intrinsically linked to the [Concordium Medica](/structure/society/profession/concordium-medica.md) and its complex system of oaths and sacrifices. It’s a time when the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) of cosmic balance are delicately assessed, and the consequences of broken promises linger.

## Origin and Purpose

Born from the observations of early Concordium physicians, the Festival of Forgotten Vows originated as a response to a troubling phenomenon. It was noticed that, as time passed, individuals bound by oaths made to the Concordium often faded from historical records. Their contributions, their failures, and the specific vows they’d made seemed to vanish, creating a dangerous gap in the collective memory.  The Concordium believed this amnesia weakened the fabric of reality, allowing imbalances to fester unnoticed. The festival was instituted to counteract this phenomenon, serving as both a memorial and a subtle reminder of the debt owed to the Concordium.

## Rituals and Traditions

The Festival is marked by a series of solemn rituals:

*   **The Reading of the Lost Vows:** For seven days leading up to the main event, appointed scribes publicly recite fragmented records of vows made to the Concordium over the past century. These aren’t full accounts, but snippets – key phrases, vague descriptions of the promises made, and the consequences of their fulfillment or breakage. It's a poignant reminder of lives affected, burdens carried, and the enduring power of oaths. 
*   **The Echoing Bells:** At the festival's peak, specially crafted bells are rung at dawn. Each bell is associated with a specific category of vow - healing oaths, neutrality pledges, forgotten sacrifices. The sound is intentionally mournful, intended to stir the memories of those who might unknowingly be tied to a forgotten obligation.
*   **The Offering of Remembrance:** Individuals suspected of having forgotten an oath, or those who believe they might be bound by one, are encouraged to bring offerings to a designated shrine. These offerings aren't for the Concordium, but for the memory of the vow itself - a symbolic gesture of acknowledgment. These offerings are recorded by scribes and stored within the Concordium's archives, allowing scholars to reconstruct the missing details of these forgotten pledges.
*   **The Silent Walk:** A procession, comprised of Concordium physicians, scribes, and local scholars, travels through designated areas of the region. It’s a time of quiet contemplation, a physical representation of the search for lost vows.

## Connection to the Concordium Medica

The Festival of Forgotten Vows is inseparable from the [Concordium Medica](/structure/society/profession/concordium-medica.md). It’s not a celebration in the traditional sense, but a vital process for maintaining the delicate balance upheld by the order. The Concordium physicians actively participate in the festival, attending the readings, analyzing the offerings, and searching for clues within the echoes of the past. The Festival helps them identify potential imbalances, offering a chance to subtly steer events and prevent catastrophic consequences stemming from forgotten obligations. It is said that particularly skilled physicians can sometimes sense the lingering presence of forgotten vows, allowing them to trace the original oath-taker and gently remind them of their duty.

## Regional Impact and Folklore

Local folklore surrounding the Festival often centers on warnings against disregarding promises. Stories abound of individuals who, having forgotten their Concordium vows, were plagued by strange misfortunes - a constant ache in a lost limb, a haunting melody that echoed a forgotten promise, or a sudden and inexplicable shift in their fortune. The Festival serves as a stark reminder to the populace – a cautionary tale against the dangers of forgetting one's word.  Traveling merchants often avoid the region during the festival, fearing that lingering vows could bind them to unforeseen obligations.
