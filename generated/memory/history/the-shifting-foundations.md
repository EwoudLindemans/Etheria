# The Shifting Foundations: A Chronicle of Geological Instability

## A History of Tremors & Rifts

The land of Eldeviér isn’t merely *on* the world; it’s inextricably *part* of it, a vast, interwoven structure built upon the mystical power residing within the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md). However, this symbiotic relationship has not always been stable. Historical records, pieced together from fragmented inscriptions found within ancient ruins, tell a harrowing tale of geological upheaval, devastating quakes, and the gradual warping of the very continents themselves.  Before the rise of the current kingdoms, a period known only as the 'Age of Unsettling' saw catastrophic shifts in the land, leaving indelible marks on the landscape and influencing Eldeviér’s culture and beliefs.

## The Root Cause: Resonance and the Scales

Scholars of the Archiving Guild theorize that the instability stems from a delicate [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) between the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) and the planar energies flowing beneath Eldeviér. The Scales aren't just passively existing structures; they act as conduits, absorbing and radiating magical energy from the lower planes, notably from [The Dense](/geography/cosmology/plane-of-existance/the-dense.md). This constant flow, if disrupted or overcharged, can create seismic stress. Evidence suggests that overuse of Scale-derived [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), particularly during the Age of Unsettling, amplified this strain. Legends whisper of a lost civilization, the 'Magelords of Xar,' who recklessly tapped into the Scales’ power, causing massive rifts to tear across the land and triggering epochs of violent earthquakes.

## Notable Geological Events

*   **The Great Sundering (Approximately 1,500 years ago):** The most catastrophic event in Eldeviér's history. A colossal tremor ripped the continent of [Morakai](/geography/continent/morakai.md) in half, creating a vast chasm now known as the [Triz Valley](/geography/settlement/city/triz-valley.md). The event is linked to a desperate magical ritual performed by the Magelords of Xar in an attempt to amplify their power. Fragments of arcane technology recovered from the valley suggest they were attempting to create a '[resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) amplifier' that ultimately backfired.  The resulting shift also exposed a previously unknown network of tunnels, now known as the [Mountains of Triz](/geography/landmark/mountains-of-triz.md), believed to lead to subterranean realms.
*   **The Rise of [Arkona](/geography/settlement/city/arkona.md) (800 years ago):** A sudden upwelling of earth created a mountainous plateau, from which the city of Arkona quickly arose. The event, while beneficial for the city’s inhabitants, caused significant displacement for nomadic tribes who previously roamed the region.
*   **The Rending Night's Expansion (ongoing):** The Desert of the Rendishing Night has been slowly expanding for centuries, swallowing surrounding fertile lands. Seismological readings show a connection between the desert’s encroachment and subtle tremors emanating from the [Umperas Hull](/geography/landmark/scale/umperas-hull.md), implying a weakening or destabilization of that particular [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md).

## The Ornite Ring's Influence

Some scholars have tentatively linked the increased geological activity with the [Ornite Ring](/geography/landmark/scale/ornite-ring.md). While the Ring’s purpose remains enigmatic, its constant orbital motion and the subtle shifts in its red inner lining are correlated with periods of seismic instability. Theories range from the Ring acting as a cosmic regulator, responding to imbalances within Eldeviér, to it being a symptom of a deeper, more fundamental flaw in the world's structure. 

## The Current State and Future Threats

While the intensity of geological events has lessened compared to the Age of Unsettling, the threat remains. Minor tremors are a frequent occurrence, and the slow, inexorable expansion of the Rendishing Night presents an ongoing challenge. The Sisterhood of Assassination are rumored to have discovered a relic that can be used to manipulate [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md). Given the events of the Age of Unsettling, many fear a new catastrophic event is inevitable and the race to prevent it is already underway.
