# Resonance Binding

## A Tradition of Linking Essence

[Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Binding is a rare and complex tradition practiced primarily within the [Glimmering Ashenburrow](/geography/settlement/city/glimmering-ashenburrow.md) and among select metallurgist guilds of [Iridia](/geography/cosmology/iridia.md). It involves the ritualistic imbuing of crafted objects – particularly those incorporating [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) fragments – with traces of a sentient being’s essence, creating a symbiotic link between the object and the individual.  This isn't necromancy; it's a carefully controlled transfer of residual energies, leaving the original being unaffected, and allowing for controlled access to specific abilities or skills through the imbued item. 

## Core Principles

*   **[Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md):**  The underlying belief is that all sentient beings possess a unique resonant frequency - a distinct energetic signature. This signature isn't a soul, but rather a collection of memories, talents, and ingrained behaviors. 
*   **[Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) Attunement:** Scale, the rare and incredibly resonant material found within [Iridia](/geography/cosmology/iridia.md), acts as a conduit for this transfer. Its unique properties allow it to store and amplify energetic patterns, making it ideal for [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Binding.
*   **Consent & Ethics:** A central tenet is *voluntary participation*. The individual granting their essence *must* offer consent. Coercion or extraction are considered abhorrent and lead to severe repercussions within the tradition.
*   **Fragmentary Transfer:** [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Binding *doesn’t* transfer consciousness or core identity. It selectively extracts specific skills, memories, or talents—a fragment of their resonance—and anchors it within the [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-infused object.
*   **Symbiotic Link:**  The link created is a two-way street. While the object grants access to the imbued skill, the imbued individual retains a subtle awareness of the object and its use, creating a unique form of empathetic connection.

## The Ritual

The [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Binding ritual is a multi-stage process requiring significant skill and precision.

1.  **Attunement Phase:** The object (typically a weapon, tool, or piece of jewelry incorporating [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)) is carefully prepared and cleansed, ensuring a clear energetic field.
2.  **[Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Scan:** A skilled Resonance Weaver uses specialized instruments to scan and map the individual’s resonant signature, identifying the target skill or talent.
3.  **Fragment Extraction:** A complex series of incantations and focused energy manipulation allows the Weaver to extract a small fragment of the [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md)—a
