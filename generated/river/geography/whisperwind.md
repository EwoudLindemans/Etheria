# Whisperwind River

## General Description

The Whisperwind River is a long, winding river that cuts through the heart of the Greypeak Mountains and flows into the Verdant Coast.  It's known for its unusually gentle current, which allows for easy navigation, and the constant, low murmur it produces as it flows over the riverbed – hence its name.

## Geography & Environment

*   **Source:** High in the Greypeak Mountains, originating from the melting snow of Mount Cinderheart. 
*   **Course:** It snakes through narrow, forested valleys in the upper reaches, then widens considerably as it descends towards the plains.  Several smaller tributaries feed into it, including the Echo Creek and the Shadowbrook.
*   **Width:** Ranges from 20 feet in the upper reaches to over 100 feet wide in the lower, more expansive areas.
*   **Depth:** Variable, ranging from shallow riffles to surprisingly deep pools (up to 30 feet in places) where it passes through gorges.
*   **Riverbed:** Composed primarily of smooth, grey stone and sand. Numerous submerged rocks and ledges create swirling currents.
*   **Flora:** Along the banks, you’re likely to find willow trees, river birch, and patches of wildflowers, particularly in the spring.  Beneath the water, a vibrant ecosystem of aquatic plants thrives.
*   **Fauna:**  The Whisperwind supports a rich variety of wildlife, including trout, salmon (during spawning season), otters, beavers, and various waterfowl. Rumors persist of larger, more unusual creatures lurking in the deeper pools, though concrete evidence remains elusive.

## Settlements & Points of Interest

*   **Riverwatch:** A small trading post and ferry crossing located at the river's junction with the Old Forest Road.  A reliable source of information and supplies for travelers.
*   **Whisperbend:** A village known for its skilled boatbuilders and fishermen.  Their handcrafted boats are highly sought after.
*   **Stonecrest:** An ancient Dwarven ruin partially submerged along the riverbank.  Local legends claim it was a stronghold of a forgotten clan.
*   **Silver Falls:** A stunning waterfall where the river plunges over a cliff face, creating a misty spray and a powerful roar.

## Navigation & Trade

*   **Current:** Generally gentle, but can be unpredictable around submerged rocks and bends.
*   **Best Time for Travel:** Spring and early summer offer the most favorable conditions, with moderate temperatures and manageable water levels.
*   **Trade Routes:** The Whisperwind is a vital trade artery, connecting the Greypeak Mountains with the Verdant Coast. Primarily used for transporting timber, fish, and crafted goods.

## Folklore & Rumors

*   The constant murmuring of the river is said to carry whispers of the past, and some claim to hear voices speaking to them from the water.
*   Local legends speak of a hidden treasure – the 'Riverstone Heart' – said to be a large, glowing gemstone concealed somewhere along the riverbed.
