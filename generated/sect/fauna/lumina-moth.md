# Lumina Moth

## Description

The Lumina Moth ( *Lucemapter undula* ) is a rare and fascinating species of moth native to the Glowstone Caves beneath the [city of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md). Unlike most moths, the Lumina Moth does not feed on nectar or plant matter. Instead, it derives sustenance from absorbing ambient magical [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) within the caves. This process manifests as a soft, internal bioluminescence, giving the moth its name.

They are relatively small, with a wingspan averaging 3-5 centimeters. Their wings are translucent, with intricate patterns of silver and blue veins that shimmer in the glowstone light. The moth’s body is a delicate silver, and they possess unusually long antennae, which they use to detect subtle shifts in magical fields.

## Habitat and Behavior

Lumina Moths are exclusively found in the Glowstone Caves, primarily in areas with high concentrations of glowstone and residual magical [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) from ancient rituals. They are nocturnal creatures, spending the daylight hours resting amongst the phosphorescent fungi and mineral formations within the caves.

Their flight is graceful and undulating, appearing to dance with the subtle currents of magical energy within the caves. They are solitary creatures, rarely congregating in groups.  A unique aspect of their behaviour is their ability to subtly manipulate the [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) around them, creating small, shimmering distortions in the light that can be interpreted as faint melodies. These “songs” are believed to be a form of communication, though the precise meaning remains unknown.

## Resonance Consumption & Effects

The Lumina Moth's primary method of sustenance is by absorbing ambient magical [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md). This process leaves a “residue” within the moth, which accumulates a delicate, crystalline structure within its wings.  When startled or agitated, the moth can release a brief, controlled burst of this resonance as a form of defense. This burst appears as a miniature flash of light and causes a temporary disruption of minor magical effects within a short radius.

### Resonance Consumption - Side Effects (rare)

While rare, exceptionally potent [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) concentrations can lead to unusual side-effects on Lumina Moths, including:

*   **Color Shift:** Exposure to particular magical spectra (especially those associated with Illusion [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md)) can cause the moth's wing patterns to temporarily shift colors.
*   **Enhanced Melody:** A moth exposed to intensely rhythmic [resonances](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) can produce a more complex and pronounced “song”.
*   **Temporal Echo:** In extremely rare cases, contact with distorted temporal [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) has been observed to create a faint, shimmering echo of the moth's past appearance, fleetingly superimposed upon its current form.

## Relationship with the Lumina Caves Ecosystem

The Lumina Moth plays a vital, though poorly understood, role in the Glowstone Caves ecosystem. It is believed that their [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) consumption helps to maintain the stability of the caves’ magical field, preventing dangerous fluctuations.  Certain cave-dwelling species, such as the Blind Cave Skitter and the Resonance Grub, are partially reliant on the moth’s discarded resonance residue for sustenance.

## Cultural Significance

To the Orinite, the Lumina Moth is seen as a symbol of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), resilience, and the delicate balance of nature.  Seeing one is considered a sign of good fortune and a reminder to appreciate the hidden wonders of the world below the city.

### Orinite Folklore

*   **The Moth’s Lament:** It’s said that a Lumina Moth will only sing if it senses deep sadness or unrest in the hearts of those nearby.
*   **The Guiding Light:** Legend claims that a lost traveler can find their way through the caves by following the light of a Lumina Moth, as long as they approach it with reverence and good intentions.
