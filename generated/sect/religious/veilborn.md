# The Veilborn

## The Mystics of the Shifting Boundaries

The Veilborn are a reclusive sect devoted to [Xal'Zyra](/being/deity/xal-zyra.md), the [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md) of hidden paths, shadows, and the flow of passage.  They reside primarily near the boundaries of [the Dense](/geography/cosmology/plane-of-existance/the-dense.md) and other places where the fabric of reality seems thin or unstable. Unlike many religious orders, the Veilborn aren't focused on spreading their faith but rather on understanding and interpreting the subtle shifts in space and reality, guiding (or subtly manipulating) others who venture near these boundaries.

## Core Beliefs and Practices

*   **Reading the Veils:** The central tenet of the Veilborn is the ability to “read” the Veil – to perceive the subtle distortions in space, the echoes of other realities, and the currents of passage that flow between worlds. This is achieved through intense meditation, sensory deprivation, and rituals that involve prolonged exposure to unstable zones.
*   **The Shifting Labyrinth:**  Veilborn initiates undergo a grueling process known as the Shifting Labyrinth. Within this labyrinth, reality itself bends and changes – corridors twist, rooms appear and disappear, and the boundaries between the physical and ethereal become blurred.  Successful navigation demonstrates an ability to adapt to unpredictable change and a nascent ability to manipulate the fabric of reality.
*   **The Oracle’s Echo:** The most skilled Veilborn become Oracles.  They can receive fragmented glimpses of the future or echoes of past events by focusing on points where the Veil is particularly thin. These glimpses are often cryptic and open to interpretation, leading to a culture of careful deliberation.
*   **The Silent Guidance:** Veilborn rarely offer direct instructions. They prefer subtle nudges – a cryptic riddle, a mysteriously appearing landmark, a feeling of inexplicable compulsion – to guide travelers away from danger or towards desired outcomes.
*   **Preservation of Boundaries:** While they explore and understand the Veil, Veilborn are fiercely protective of its integrity. They consider reckless tampering with boundaries to be a grave offense, believing it risks collapsing reality or inviting unwelcome entities.

## Structure and Hierarchy

*   **The Seers:**  The highest rank within the Veilborn, Seers are those who have achieved mastery in reading the Veil and interpreting its echoes. They act as advisors, mediators, and keepers of the order’s accumulated knowledge.
*   **The Guides:**  Experienced Veilborn who act as intermediaries, subtly guiding travelers through dangerous or unpredictable zones.
*   **The Listeners:**  Novice Veilborn who spend their time observing and recording subtle changes in the environment, attempting to discern patterns and identify points of instability.
*   **The Bound (Initiates):** Those undergoing the Shifting Labyrinth and initial training.

## Relationship to Xal'Zyra

The Veilborn believe they are conduits for [Xal'Zyra](/being/deity/xal-zyra.md)’s wisdom, not its direct servants. They view themselves as scholars and interpreters of the Veil, not as priests seeking to command it. They actively study Xal'Zyra’s influence on the world, seeking to understand its patterns and intentions.  They are more likely to ask
