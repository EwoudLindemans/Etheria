# Aethelgard: The Shattered Coast

## A Land Forged in Ruin and Echoes

Aethelgard is the westernmost continent of [Iridia](/geography/cosmology/iridia.md), a vast, fractured landmass defined by its dramatic coastline and the lingering effects of a cataclysm known as the Sundering. Unlike the flourishing woodlands of the [Verdant Divide](/geography/region/verdant-divide.md), Aethelgard is a scarred beauty—a testament to elemental fury and the slow, persistent march of resilience. Its geography is dominated by towering mesas, deep fjords carved by glacial retreat, and sprawling salt marshes where the ghosts of ancient seas still whisper.

## History: The Sundering and the Obsidian Kingdoms

Millennia ago, before recorded history, Aethelgard was a single, unbroken land ruled by the Obsidian Kingdoms—a civilization renowned for their mastery of stonecraft and their harnessing of seismic energies. These kingdoms possessed a complex understanding of [Iridia](/geography/cosmology/iridia.md)’s underlying tectonic forces, allowing them to build magnificent cities and intricate networks of tunnels that pulsed with geothermal power. However, their ambition ultimately proved to be their undoing. In a desperate attempt to tap into a primordial source of seismic energy known as the Deepheart, the Obsidian Kingdoms triggered the Sundering - a catastrophic event that shattered the continent into a jigsaw puzzle of islands, mesas, and submerged valleys. The Deepheart was sealed, but not before unleashing a wave of elemental instability that reshaped the entire region. Scattered remnants of the Obsidian Kingdoms remain - colossal statues half-swallowed by the ocean, crumbling archways inscribed with forgotten runes, and subterranean complexes teeming with strange echoes and mutated fauna.

## Geography and Environment

Aethelgard’s climate is harsh and unpredictable, ranging from frigid, windswept plateaus to humid, swampy lowlands. The lingering effects of the Sundering have resulted in localized zones of elemental instability—areas where the earth trembles without warning, where shards of crystallized mana drift through the air, and where bizarre, mutated flora and fauna thrive.  Significant geographic features include:

*   **The Spine of the Wyrm:** A jagged mountain range running north to south, rumored to contain veins of raw mana and the petrified remains of an ancient, colossal Wyrm. It's said to be the most unstable area of the continent.
*   **The Murkmire:** A vast, fetid swamp choked with strange, bioluminescent fungi and populated by monstrous amphibians and insects. It’s a key location in [Velkrin](/being/species/velkrin.md) mythos – a region considered to be a thin point between [Iridia](/geography/cosmology/iridia.md) and the Between, where wandering Veydrassi are especially prevalent.
*   **The Obsidian Fjords:** Deep, icy waterways cutting through the western coastline, offering a treacherous path for ships but also access to mineral-rich deposits along their shores.
*   **The Shifting Sands:** A sprawling desert region in the east, marked by constantly changing dunes and powerful sandstorms that reveal and bury ancient ruins in equal measure.

## Inhabitants: Scavengers, Exiles, and Remnants

Due to the harsh environment and its history of devastation, Aethelgard is sparsely populated. The primary inhabitants are:

*   **The Shorelings:** Hardy scavengers and traders who eke out a living by salvaging wreckage from the ancient Obsidian Kingdoms and trading with ships that brave the treacherous coastlines. Many are descendants of survivors who adapted to the volatile landscape. 
*   **The Exiled:** Various groups of individuals banished from other continents for crimes or heresy often settle in the more isolated regions of Aethelgard.  Some are seeking refuge, others are plotting revenge.
*   **The Echo-kin:**  A reclusive, mutated people descended from Obsidian Kingdom artisans. They retain some of the ancient knowledge of stonecraft and seismic manipulation, but are often driven mad by the echoes of the Sundering.  Their abilities connect to the [Velkrin](/being/species/velkrin.md) [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) traditions, particularly concerning their manipulation of stone and tremors.
*   **[Velkrin](/being/species/velkrin.md) Presence:** While not dominant, scattered pockets of Velkrin, particularly Veydrassi and Grovekith, are drawn to Aethelgard’s fractured landscape.  They seek out sites of elemental instability and ancient [resonances](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md), drawn to the continent’s power.

## Connections to Existing Lore

The remnants of the Obsidian Kingdoms hold potential clues to understanding the true nature of the Deepheart and the potential dangers of harnessing seismic energies – knowledge that could be vital in preventing another cataclysm.  The unstable zones on Aethelgard could be focal points for the influence of the Between, providing a possible avenue for the emergence of new threats and the return of forgotten entities. The knowledge held by the Echo-kin, specifically their ability to manipulate [resonances](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) related to earth and tremors, could provide an avenue for understanding the power held by the Veydrassi and the secrets of manipulation between the physical world and the Between.
