# The Whispering Peaks

## A Range Shrouded in Secrets and Echoes

The Whispering Peaks are a formidable range dominating the eastern borderlands of the Kingdom of Aeridor. Unlike many mountain ranges sculpted by tectonic forces, these peaks seem to have *grown* â€“ jutting upwards with unnerving speed over centuries, exhibiting strange crystalline formations and resonating with an eerie, almost sentient hum.

## Geography and Formation

*   **Height & Extent:** Reaching heights of up to 18,000 feet, the Whispering Peaks stretch for nearly 300 miles, forming a jagged barrier between Aeridor and the untamed expanse known as the Shadowfen. Their width averages 50 miles, expanding and contracting at various points.
*   **Crystalline Structure:** The defining feature of the Whispering Peaks is the prevalence of colossal crystal formations - primarily quartz, amethyst, and a unique, light-sensitive mineral called 'Echo Stone'. These crystals are interwoven within the rock, sometimes forming massive, cathedral-like caverns within the mountainsides. The Echo Stone reacts to sound, amplifying and storing it, creating the Peaks' namesake
