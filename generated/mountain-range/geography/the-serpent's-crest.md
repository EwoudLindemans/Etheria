# The Serpent's Crest

## A Range Woven from Stone and Myth

The Serpent's Crest is a formidable mountain range dominating the southwestern borders of the Kingdom of Eldoria. Its name derives from the range's distinctive, winding form, resembling a colossal serpent coiled around a valley. The mountains are renowned for their treacherous peaks, unpredictable weather, and the ancient, almost sentient, feeling that pervades the region.

## Geography and Topography

The range stretches approximately 300 miles, rising to a maximum elevation of 12,000 feet at the peak of Dragon's Tooth. The mountains are primarily composed of granite and basalt, sculpted over millennia by glacial activity and erosion. 

*   **Dragon's Tooth:** The highest peak, perpetually shrouded in mist and rumored to be a nesting place for ancient dragons (though no confirmed sightings have been recorded in centuries).
*   **Whisperwind Pass:** The only relatively accessible route through the range, known for its eerie whistling winds that carry fragmented voices, giving rise to local legends of lost souls.
*   **Shadow Gorge:** A deep, perpetually dark ravine where sunlight rarely penetrates. Said to be inhabited by creatures that shun the light.
*   **The Azure Pools:** A series of high-altitude lakes fed by melting snow and glacial runoff. The water is an unnatural shade of blue, attributed to rare mineral deposits.

## Climate and Weather

The Serpent’s Crest experiences a harsh, alpine climate.  Temperatures are consistently low, even during the warmer months.  Snowfall is heavy and prolonged, and avalanches are a constant danger.

*   **Perpetual Mist:** A thick fog frequently blankets the higher elevations, significantly reducing visibility and making navigation difficult.
*   **Sudden Storms:** The region is prone to sudden, violent thunderstorms that can strike without warning.
*   **The Cinder Winds:**  Rare, hot winds that sweep down from the peaks, carrying ash and the scent of sulfur – a remnant of ancient volcanic activity.

## History and Lore

The Serpent's Crest holds a place of significant importance in Eldorian folklore. Legends tell of ancient battles fought amongst the peaks, where heroes clashed with monstrous beings from the depths of the earth.

*   **The Dragonstone Pact:** A historical treaty supposedly forged between the ancient Elves and a powerful dragon on the summit of Dragon's Tooth, establishing a period of peace.
*   **The Lost City of Veridian:**  Rumors persist of a hidden Elven city, Veridian, swallowed by the mountains centuries ago.  Treasure hunters and scholars alike have sought it without success.
*   **The Guardian Spirits:** Locals believe the mountains are protected by ancestral spirits, who can manifest as swirling mists or protective winds.

## Flora and Fauna

The harsh environment supports a limited, yet resilient, ecosystem. 

*   **Ironwood Trees:**  A hardy species of tree with incredibly dense wood, found clinging to the lower slopes.
*   **Snow Leopards:** Elusive predators adapted to the alpine conditions.
*   **Mountain Goats:**  Surefooted climbers capable of traversing the most precarious cliffs.
*   **Stone Hawks:** A breed of hawk with remarkably sharp eyesight, believed to be messengers of the mountain spirits.
