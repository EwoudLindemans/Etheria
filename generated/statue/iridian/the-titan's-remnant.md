# Statue: The Titan's Remnant

## Description

The Titan's Remnant is a colossal statue, partially embedded within a towering crystalline spire known as the 'Shard of Echoes'. It is believed to be a fragment of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md), the fallen titan whose collapse formed the world of [Iridia](/geography/cosmology/iridia.md). The statue is not entirely stone; shimmering, otherworldly energies pulse through its crystalline veins, hinting at the potent Residue that flows through it.

It stands approximately 150 feet tall, depicting a humanoid form with exaggerated features – a broad chest, massive shoulders, and an elongated head tilted towards the heavens. Its hands, though partially eroded by time, still clutch a fractured sphere of unknown composition, its surface etched with swirling patterns that seem to shift and writhe before the eye.

The most striking aspect of the statue is its composition. Primarily a dark, obsidian-like material, sections of it are interwoven with vibrant, pulsing crystals that resonate with residual magical energy. Runes, unlike any known language, are subtly carved into the stone, appearing to glow with an internal light.

## Location

The statue is located within the 'Residue Peaks', a range of impossibly tall mountains formed by the initial impact of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)'s fall. It’s situated within a hidden valley called 'Whispering Coves,' accessible only through a series of treacherous, winding paths and magically-shifted portals.

## History & Significance

Legend dictates the statue was one of the first monuments erected in [Iridia](/geography/cosmology/iridia.md), built by a now-vanished civilization known as the 'Aetherweavers.' They believed the statue to be a conduit for [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)’s consciousness, a way to commune with the fallen titan and harness its power. The Aetherweavers disappeared mysteriously, leaving behind only their magnificent statues and cryptic writings.

For centuries, the statue has served as a pilgrimage site for various factions: scholars seeking to decipher the Aetherweavers' knowledge, mages attempting to tap into the Residual energies, and cultists seeking to awaken the fallen titan. The area around the statue is known to exhibit unpredictable magical phenomena, making it both a source of immense power and a constant danger.

## Magical Properties

*   **Residue Amplification:** The statue significantly amplifies the potency of any Residual [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) channeled nearby. Spells and rituals performed in its presence are noticeably more powerful, though also more volatile.
*   **Echoes of Consciousness:** Those with strong magical abilities or a deep connection to [Iridia](/geography/cosmology/iridia.md)'s history can experience fleeting visions or echoes of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)'s thoughts and memories while near the statue. These visions are fragmented and unreliable, but can provide valuable insights into the titan’s past and the events surrounding its fall.
*   **Warding Against Void Entities:** The statue possesses a subtle warding effect against Void entities, preventing them from readily manifesting within a 50-foot radius. However, this effect weakens with prolonged exposure to Void [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md).

## Associated Factions

*   **The Aetherium Scholars:** A clandestine order dedicated to uncovering the secrets of the Aetherweavers and understanding the statue’s true purpose.
*   **The Cult of the Sleeping Titan:** A fanatical group seeking to awaken [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md) and usher in a new age of magical dominance.
*   **The Wardens of the Peaks:** A neutral order charged with protecting the statue and maintaining the delicate balance of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) in the surrounding region.
