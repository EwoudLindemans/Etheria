# Whisperweed (Silvanus murmura)

## A Plant of Secrets and Shared Memories

Whisperweed is a peculiar, flowering plant found primarily in shadowed groves and ancient ruins within the [Skein of Bones](/geography/region/skein-of-bones.md) and occasionally in heavily forested areas along the edges of the Greatwood.

### Appearance

*   **Height:** Typically 1-2 feet tall, though larger specimens have been reported.
*   **Leaves:** Delicate, silver-grey leaves that shimmer faintly in the light. They are covered in tiny, almost invisible hairs.
*   **Flowers:** Small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pale blue and lavender. They emit a subtle, almost imperceptible fragrance.
*   **Stem:** A slender, flexible stem that seems to sway even without a breeze.

### Magical Properties

Whisperweed's most notable property is its ability to passively absorb and retransmit residual emotional energy from its surroundings. It functions as a kind of living echo chamber for the past. The plant does not 'record' events in any objective sense, but rather absorbs lingering feelings of joy, sorrow, fear, anger, etc.

*   **Emotional [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md):** When touched or near, Whisperweed imparts a subtle emotional impression to those nearby. Touching a Whisperweed that grew near a battlefield might evoke a fleeting sensation of dread or loss, while one near a wedding site might inspire feelings of warmth and affection.
*   **Shared Memories (Limited):** Skilled empaths or those trained in emotional manipulation can 'read' the plant and extract fragments of past emotional experiences. These aren't precise recollections, but rather impressions – a sense of the *feeling* associated with a past event.  Attempts to extract memories from multiple plants simultaneously can create a chaotic blend of emotions and sensations.
*   **Amplification of Emotion:** When exposed to a strong emotional presence (someone crying, arguing, celebrating), Whisperweed noticeably amplifies that emotion within a small radius. This can create unnerving atmospheres or inadvertently trigger emotional responses in those nearby.

### Cultivation and Use

*   **Difficult to Cultivate:** Whisperweed is notoriously difficult to cultivate. It requires specific soil conditions (a mix of ash and peat) and thrives in areas where ley lines intersect. It will not grow outside of its natural environment and quickly wilts if transplanted.
*   **Emotional Analysis (Rare):** Some specialized historians and mages use carefully harvested Whisperweed to glean impressions of significant emotional events in the past. However, the interpretations are subjective and unreliable.
*   **Aromatic Blend (Uncommon):** Crushed Whisperweed petals can be blended with incense to create a fragrance said to induce a contemplative state and heighten emotional awareness. It is considered a delicacy by some and is also used to treat insomnia.
*   **Ritualistic Purposes (Limited):** Some dark rituals utilize Whisperweed to amplify negative emotions and manipulate emotional states. Such practices are highly frowned upon and can be dangerous.

### Folklore and Legends

*   It is said that Whisperweed grows particularly well near places where great tragedies have occurred.
*   Some believe that the whispers emanating from the plant are the voices of those who have died.
*   Local legends tell of individuals becoming “lost” within the plant’s memories, unable to distinguish past experiences from their own.

### Warnings

*   Prolonged exposure to Whisperweed can be emotionally draining.  It is not recommended for those with pre-existing emotional instability.
*   Do not attempt to force memories from the plant; doing so can result in emotional backlash or even madness.
