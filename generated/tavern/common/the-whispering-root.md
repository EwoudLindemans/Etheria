## A Uroxi Gathering Place in the Edge of Umberdeep

![whispering-root.webp](/tavern/common/whispering-root.webp = 500x)

The Whispering Root isn’t your typical tavern. Carved directly into the living root system that laces the edges of [Umberdeep](/geography/settlement/city/umberdeep.md), this establishment pulses with a faint, earthy [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md). It’s a place where [Uroxi](/being/species/uroxi.md) go to trade news, settle disputes (usually through ritualized grapples), and share stories over steaming bowls of lichen-bread and spiced root stew. While open to all (and anyone brave enough to navigate the twisting tunnels leading to it), it's undeniably *centered* around Uroxi culture and customs.

**Location:** Situated near a major Glowroot Walk on the fringes of [Umberdeep](/geography/settlement/city/umberdeep.md), close to the outer tunnels where trade caravans from the surface occasionally pass through. It’s about a day's travel from the Corefold.

**Atmosphere:** The tavern is dimly lit by hanging Glowspore Galls and strategically placed Resocryst blooms. The air is thick with the smell of damp earth, roasting root vegetables, and a peculiar, resonant hum that seems to vibrate in your very bones. The walls are living root, twisted and gnarled, adorned with carvings of clan spirals, victorious battles, and warnings of underground dangers. A constant [drip](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-cauldron-lottery/drip.md) of water echoes through the space, punctuated by the occasional grunts and rumbling conversations of the clientele.

**Layout:**

*   **The Root Hall:** The main gathering area, a large, open space filled with long, communal tables carved from living root. A central hearth built into a massive root thick with luminescent fungi provides warmth and light.
*   **The [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Nook:** A smaller, quieter area near the back, where patrons can meditate, listen to the rhythmic pulse of the cave, or consult with a local resonator. This area is said to amplify thoughts and emotions—be warned.
*   **The Grapple Circle:** A designated area for ritualized grappling matches. While not always in use, it’s a constant reminder of [Uroxi](/being/species/uroxi.md) notions of honor and conflict resolution.
*   **The Keeper’s Den:** A small, private room where the tavern keeper, **Khazgra**, oversees operations and settles disputes. Her word is law in these halls.

**Food & Drink:**

*   **Lichen-Bread:** A staple food – baked from crushed lichen and root flour, served warm.
*   **Root Stew:** A hearty stew made from various root vegetables, fungi, and (occasionally) cave-goat. Highly customizable with local spices.
*   **Glowspore Brew:** A mildly alcoholic beverage brewed from Glowspore Galls. Gives a slight luminescence to the drinker.
*   **[Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Tea:** A blend of rare cave herbs and roots, said to enhance mental clarity and attunement to the resonance.

**Notable Patrons:**

*   **Khazgra:** The gruff but fair tavern keeper, a veteran grappler and respected member of the local clan.
*   **Rokk’tharr:** A wandering resonator, often found in the [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Nook, offering guidance and interpreting the echoes of the cave.
*   **Various [Uroxi](/being/species/uroxi.md) traders, miners, and caravaneers:** Regularly stop in for sustenance and news.
*   **Occasional surface travelers:** Those brave enough to venture into the depths.

**Rumors & Lore:**

*   It's said that the root system surrounding the tavern is particularly sensitive to the [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md), and that the tavern walls sometimes whisper secrets to those who listen closely.
*   The tavern is rumored to be a meeting point for a clandestine network of traders dealing in rare and forbidden goods from the surface world.
*   The Resocryst blooms used to light the tavern are said to hold memories of past grapples and clan disputes.
