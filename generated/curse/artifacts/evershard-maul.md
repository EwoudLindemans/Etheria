# Evershard Maul

## Relic of Shattered Titans

The Evershard Maul is a legendary warhammer forged by the [Tuskbreakers](/structure/society/profession/tuskbreaker.md), renowned for its earth-shattering strikes and the echoes of battles long past it carries. It's a signature creation, and a symbol of the Tuskbreaker's mastery over ancient power.

## History & Lore

Legends whisper of the Evershard Maul being crafted from the skull of a particularly colossal Titan Beast—a creature whose roars could shatter mountains and whose wrath leveled entire forests.  After a particularly devastating battle, the [Tuskbreaker](/structure/society/profession/tuskbreaker.md) chief, Gorgoth Stonefist, tasked his finest artisans to recover and reshape the Titan's skull into a weapon of unrivaled might. The forging process took months, involving ritualistic chanting, bone-searing heat, and tireless physical labor. The finished Maul was deemed a testament to the Tuskbreakers' resilience and reverence for the power of the past.

Some scholars believe the Maul retains a fragment of the Titan's consciousness, causing minor tremors with each strike and occasionally echoing the Titan's enraged roars. Others claim that the Maul actively seeks out moments of intense conflict, growing stronger and more ferocious with each battle it participates in.

## Appearance & Construction

The Evershard Maul is an imposing weapon. It’s approximately 4 feet long, with a massive, roughly hewn head shaped from the Titan’s skull. Deep fissures and cracks crisscross the skull’s surface, filled with glowing, crimson resin – a signature of [Tuskbreaker](/structure/society/profession/tuskbreaker.md) crafting.  The handle is wrapped in thick, cured leather, reinforced with embedded bone fragments. Intricate carvings depicting scenes of ancient battles adorn the handle, subtly pulsing with latent power.

The skull itself retains a faint, spectral glow, most noticeable in dim lighting. Closer inspection reveals tiny, hairline fractures that subtly widen and contract with each impact.

## Powers & Properties

*   **Earthshaking Strikes:** The Maul's primary power is its ability to generate shockwaves upon impact. Each strike creates a localized tremor, knocking enemies off balance and potentially causing them to stumble or fall. A successful hit can deal extra bludgeoning damage based on the target's size and proximity to the epicenter of the shockwave.
*   **Titan's Echo:**  When swung with sufficient force, the Maul emits a low, guttural rumble reminiscent of a Titan’s roar.  This serves as a psychological weapon, potentially demoralizing enemies and inciting fear.
*   **Seismic [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md):** The Maul resonates with the earth itself.  The wielder can subtly sense shifts in the ground and detect the presence of underground tunnels or hidden chambers, though this requires focused concentration.
*   **Reinforced Skull:** The skull material itself is incredibly durable, providing a significant armor bonus to the wielder, reducing the severity of incoming attacks.

## Weaknesses

*   **Weight:** The Maul is incredibly heavy, requiring significant strength to wield effectively.  Weaker individuals risk injuring themselves through overuse.
*   **[Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Vulnerability:** The Maul’s resonance is disrupted by high-frequency sounds or magical dampening fields. In such environments, its power is significantly diminished.
*   **Fracture Risk:** While durable, the Maul’s existing cracks and fissures are vulnerable to specific types of damage – particularly concentrated sonic attacks or targeted magical strikes.

## Known Wielders

*   **Gorgoth Stonefist:** The legendary [Tuskbreaker](/structure/society/profession/tuskbreaker.md) who commissioned the Maul's creation.
*   **Boruk Skullcrusher:** A renowned Orcish warlord who wielded the Maul during a campaign of conquest.
*   **(Currently) Unclaimed:** Following a series of skirmishes with warring factions, the Maul vanished and its whereabouts are currently unknown.
