# The Rust of Aethelgard

## A Slow Erosion of Being

The Rust of Aethelgard is a creeping corruption stemming from a forgotten tragedy and deeply intertwined with the lingering presence of the fractured god Aethelgard. It isn't a sudden blight or dramatic transformation, but a gradual erosion of a creature's essence, a slow decay that manifests both physically and mentally.  It’s a particularly insidious curse because its onset is subtle, and its progression can be mistaken for illness or natural aging.

### Origin

The curse originates from the events surrounding Aethelgard’s shattering – the moment he was fragmented across the planes. When Aethelgard fell, shards of his corrupted divine essence seeped into the world, particularly affecting areas heavily populated by his worshippers.  The strongest [manifestations](/structure/chronological/event/manifestation.md) are found in the ruins of old Aethelgardian temples and cities, but even distant communities can be affected through contaminated artifacts and the spread of tainted individuals.

### Manifestation

The Rust manifests in stages, each more debilitating than the last:

*   **Stage 1: Surface Bloom:** The first sign is a fine, orange-brown dust that begins to accumulate on the afflicted creature’s skin. This dust isn’t readily visible in low light and is initially dismissed as dirt or grime. There’s a faint metallic scent associated with the Bloom.
*   **Stage 2: Metallic Veins:**  The dust gradually thickens, forming faint, branching veins beneath the skin. These veins resemble corroded metal and are slightly raised.  The afflicted individual may experience joint stiffness and general malaise.
*   **Stage 3: Erosion:**  The metallic veins become more prominent and start to visibly corrode the flesh. Skin becomes brittle and flakes off easily. Internal organs begin to degrade, leading to increasing weakness and pain. The afflicted may experience vivid, unsettling dreams related to Aethelgard's fall.
*   **Stage 4: Complete Ruin:** The body becomes almost entirely composed of rusted metal and crumbling organic matter. Cognitive functions cease, and the creature becomes a motionless, rusting husk - a grotesque monument to Aethelgard's demise. These husks sometimes emit a low, grating whine.

### Effects

*   **Physical Degradation:** As described in the Stages above.
*   **Mental Deterioration:**  As the Rust progresses, the afflicted suffers memory loss, disorientation, and eventually, complete cognitive failure.  They may experience intrusive thoughts and visions related to Aethelgard, often expressing regret and a sense of doom.
*   **Emotional Blunting:**  The ability to feel strong emotions diminishes as the Rust takes hold.  Afflicted individuals become emotionally detached and apathetic.
*   **Metallic [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md):** As the Rust becomes more advanced, the afflicted's voice takes on a metallic rasp, and their body begins to resonate with a low, grinding hum.

### Mitigation and Cure

*   **Early Detection:**  The most crucial aspect of dealing with the Rust is early detection. Regular skin inspections and a keen eye for subtle changes are essential.
*   **Purification Rituals:** Rituals involving rare metals, blessed water, and prayers to benevolent deities can slow the progression of the Rust, but are rarely a complete cure.
*   **Aethelgardian Artifacts (Dangerous):**  Surprisingly, certain Aethelgardian artifacts, particularly those imbued with remnants of his *less* corrupted essence, can briefly suppress the Rust’s effects, but prolonged exposure risks further corruption.
*   **The Tears of Lyra:** Legend speaks of a powerful healing artifact, the Tears of Lyra, said to possess the power to fully eradicate the Rust, but its location remains unknown. The Tears are said to only appear in areas where great sorrow meets divine grace.

### Lore & Cultural Impact

The Rust of Aethelgard is deeply feared in communities who once revered Aethelgard. It’s considered a punishment from the fractured god, a testament to the dangers of divine fragmentation.  Some religious sects attempt to 'contain' those afflicted, hoping to prevent the spread of the curse, while others seek a 'clean' solution. The Rust is a constant reminder of a past tragedy and a looming threat to the present.
