# The Red Stitch Syndicate

## A Network of Menders and Malcontents

The Red Stitch Syndicate is not your typical band of highwaymen or brigands. They present themselves as travelling healers and restorers, offering their services to communities across [Iridia](/geography/cosmology/iridia.md), particularly those within reach of the colossal [Umperas Hull](/geography/landmark/scale/umperas-hull.md). However, beneath the veneer of benevolent aid lies a clandestine organization with ambitions far exceeding simple larceny.

Rooted in the peculiar environment of Innerhold Hearthstead, nestled within the [Umperas Hull](/geography/landmark/scale/umperas-hull.md), the Syndicate’s origins are intertwined with the unusual acceptance of [Ilmater](/https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ilmater), the Broken God, within [Thalgrin](/being/deity/thalgrin.md)’s domain. Many of the Syndicate’s early members were refugees finding sanctuary within the Hearthstead, individuals seeking a fresh start after loss or exile.

The Syndicate’s primary operation is a network of itinerant healing workshops and restoration services. They offer skills ranging from basic first aid and herbalism to advanced bone-setting and even rudimentary prosthetics.

*   **Recruitment:**  Sympathetic individuals, particularly those with a history of hardship or a distrust of authority, are actively recruited into the Syndicate's ranks. They are given purpose and belonging in exchange for loyalty.
*   **Subtle Manipulation:**  The Syndicate's healers frequently “diagnose” ailments that are easily exacerbated by external factors – suggesting that trade restrictions, oppressive governance, or even the presence of specific merchants are causing widespread suffering. This plants seeds of discontent and weakens community cohesion, making it easier to exploit vulnerabilities.

## The Stitchwork - Their Operations

Beyond the charitable facade, the Syndicate engages in several lucrative (and morally dubious) enterprises:

*   **Theft and Black Market:** They steal from the wealthy and powerful, redistributing some goods to those in need (to maintain their “Robin Hood” image), while the majority ends up bolstering their own coffers and funding their operations.
*   **Protection Rackets:** Leveraging their network of contacts and willingness to use force, they offer
