# The Ironclad Reavers

## Overview

The Ironclad Reavers are a heavily armored and surprisingly disciplined bandit group operating primarily in the Blackwood Pass and surrounding foothills of the Obsidian Peaks. Unlike many bandit groups that rely on ambush tactics and overwhelming numbers, the Reavers favor a more direct, armored assault, utilizing a core of veteran warriors encased in blackened steel.

## Organization

The Reavers are unusually well-organized for bandits, operating with a hierarchical structure resembling a small mercenary company more than a ragtag band of thieves.  Their leadership is comprised of:

*   **Torvin “The Hammer” Blackheart:** The ruthless and pragmatic leader of the Reavers. A veteran warrior with extensive experience in siege warfare and disciplined combat.
*   **Seraphina “The Swift” Vahl:** Torvin’s lieutenant and the Reavers’ master strategist and scout. Skilled in stealth, reconnaissance, and quick thinking.
*   **Grimbold Stonefist:**  The Reavers’ chief armorer and blacksmith, responsible for maintaining and improving their distinctive armor. A gruff but effective craftsman.

Each squad is led by a “Steel Warden”, responsible for commanding a group of 10-15 Reavers.

## Appearance & Equipment

The Reavers are easily recognizable by their distinctive blackened steel armor, often adorned with crude iron rivets and reinforced with plates salvaged from fallen military equipment. The armor is not perfectly crafted, indicating a focus on function over aesthetics. They favor:

*   **Blackened Steel Armor:** Provides superior protection compared to typical bandit equipment. Heavily prioritized over agility.
*   **Warhammers & Maces:** Their preferred weapons, designed to shatter defenses and inflict crushing blows.
*   **Shortbows & Javelins:** Used for harassing and softening up targets before a full assault.
*   **Siege Ladders & Ramming Equipment:** A testament to their history and preparation for fortified positions.

## Motivation & Goals

The Ironclad Reavers are not driven by simple greed. While they certainly collect loot, their primary motivation is to acquire power and establish a territory they can control. They see themselves as a force that can bring order to the chaotic region and are actively seeking to expand their influence.

Rumors suggest they are being funded by a mysterious benefactor, potentially a disgraced noble or a rival kingdom, seeking to destabilize the region.

## Tactics & Combat Style

The Reavers favor a slow, methodical advance, utilizing their heavy armor to shrug off attacks while steadily closing the distance. They often utilize a “hammer and anvil” tactic, using a smaller group to pin down the enemy while a larger force flanks or breaks through their lines.

They are well-versed in siege warfare and are prepared to assault fortified positions with siege equipment.

## Known Locations & Activity

*   **Blackwood Pass:** Their primary operating area, frequently disrupting trade routes and attacking caravans.
*   **The Ruined Fortress of Harrowpeak:** Suspected to be their base of operations. Heavily fortified and difficult to approach.
*   **Frequent attacks on Silverstream Village:**  Extorting supplies and recruiting new members.
