Ironclad Transports are the premier, and arguably only truly safe, merchant caravans traversing the perilous Scalewrought Expanse. Unlike other, smaller groups relying on speed and agility, Ironclad Transports prioritize security and resilience above all else. They are essentially mobile fortresses, built to withstand the most common threats - rampaging beastfolk, opportunistic bandits, and even rogue elementals.

## Organization and Structure

*   **Lead Wagon (The Sentinel):**  A heavily armored, multi-story wagon pulled by a team of six massive, specially bred Scaleforged Draft Beasts. Carries the Caravan Master, their closest advisors, and often a contingent of elite Scaleforged Guards.  Equipped with multiple ballistae and a powerful, magically-powered [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) cannon.
*   **Armored Wagons (The Bulwarks):**  These wagons are constructed with layered Scaleforged steel plates and reinforced with magical [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) fields.  They carry the majority of the goods, typically raw materials and high-value trade items. Each is guarded by a small squad of Scaleforged Guards.
*   **Security Detail (The Iron Guard):** Composed of seasoned Scaleforged Guards, a significant portion of the caravan is dedicated to security.  They patrol the perimeter, provide escort for smaller wagons, and are prepared to engage in direct combat. Often includes veteran warriors, Scaleforged Runeguardians, and even a few magically-inclined individuals.
*   **Support Wagons (The Hearthstones):**  These wagons house the caravan's support staff, including cooks, healers, smiths, and mechanics.  They also carry essential supplies like water, rations, and repair tools.

## Goods and Services

*   **High-Value Goods Transport:** Primarily handles the transport of rare ores, refined metals, magical components, and other valuable goods that require substantial protection.
*   **Escort Services:** Provides security escort for smaller caravans willing to pay a premium.
*   **Mobile Repairs:** Offers on-the-road repairs and maintenance for wagons and equipment.
*   **Information Brokerage:** Due to their wide-ranging travels, Ironclad Transports often gather valuable information about trade routes, dangers, and opportunities. 

## Reputation and Costs

Ironclad Transports command the highest rates for their services, reflecting the level of protection they offer. They are highly sought after, especially during times of increased banditry or elemental activity. While their rates are steep, those who choose them are guaranteed the safest passage through the Scalewrought Expanse.

*   **Security Escort:** Additional 0.75% of escorted cargo value + daily fee for security personnel.
*   **Emergency Repairs:** Priced on a case-by-case basis, typically 2-3 times the market rate for standard repairs.
