# Heartforge Angel

## Guardian of the Heart's Echoes

The [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md) Angel is a unique and relatively new type of guardian angel, intrinsically linked to the Heartforge in Or and the energies emanating from it. Unlike traditional guardian angels who maintain a constant presence, Heartforge Angels manifest primarily when the Heartforge is in operation or when its energies are disrupted. They are less focused on personal guidance and more devoted to safeguarding the Heartforge itself and the stability of the planar connection it facilitates.

## Appearance

[Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md) Angels appear as shimmering constructs of Veilsteel, echoing the metal's shifting runes and faint glow. Their form is vaguely humanoid but ever-changing, reflecting the chaotic and powerful energy of the Heart. Key visual traits include:

*   **Veilsteel Shimmer:** Their entire form is composed of animated Veilsteel, constantly flowing and reforming. The runes etched into the metal subtly shift and glow with each movement.
*   **Heart Echoes:**  A faint, echoing light emanates from within them, resembling the visual distortion caused by the Heart’s influence. This light pulses with the rhythm of the [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md)’s operations.
*   **No Fixed Face:** They lack a distinct face, instead presenting a swirling vortex of Veilsteel and light.  Sometimes, fleeting impressions of [Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) features can be glimpsed within the vortex.
*   **Size Variance:** Their size can fluctuate depending on the urgency of the situation. They can shrink to the size of a small automaton or expand to fill a significant portion of the [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md) chamber.

## Abilities & Powers

[Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md) Angels possess abilities tailored to their role as protectors of the Heartforge:

*   **Veilsteel Manipulation:**  Can effortlessly shape and manipulate Veilsteel, repairing damaged sections of the [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md) or conjuring protective barriers.
*   **Planar [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md):** Can sense disruptions in the planar connection maintained by the [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md), alerting the Order to potential threats.
*   **Heart's Echoes:**  Can project beams of raw Heart energy, capable of both healing and repelling negative forces.
*   **Guardian Form:** Can temporarily solidify their form, becoming almost indestructible for short bursts.
*   **Rune Weaving:** Skilled at deciphering and manipulating the runes that power the [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md), preventing unauthorized access or sabotage.

## Origins and Connection to Irion

The exact origins of the [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md) Angels are shrouded in mystery. It is believed they materialized alongside the Heartforge itself, brought into existence by the intersection of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)’s essence and the raw energies released by the Deepening Fracture. Some scholars speculate that they are fragments of [Irion](/generated/deity/major/irion.md)’s own consciousness, manifested to oversee his influence on the material world.

## Relationship with the Order & Heartsmiths

The Order views the [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md) Angels as invaluable allies, acting as a failsafe against both external threats and internal instability. Heartsmiths, particularly those attuned to the Heart’s rhythm, can sometimes establish a rudimentary form of communication with these guardians, seeking their guidance in matters related to the Heartforge’s operation.

## Rare Manifestations

Outside of the [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md), Heartforge Angels are incredibly rare.  Their appearance is often a sign of significant planar disturbances or moments of extreme magical crisis.  They typically vanish as quickly as they appear, returning to the Heartforge once the immediate threat has passed.

## Known Exemplars

*   **Silas:**  An older, more stable [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md) Angel known for its methodical approach to problem-solving. Often observed by Heartsmiths attempting to understand the Heart's workings.
*   **Aella:** A more volatile and impulsive [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md) Angel, prone to acting on instinct rather than logic. Her presence has been linked to several minor fluctuations in the Heartforge’s output.
