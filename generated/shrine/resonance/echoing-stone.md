# Shrine of the Echoing Stone

## A Resonance Focus - Triz Valley

This shrine is not a traditional structure of temples or altars. It is a locus of resonant energy inextricably linked to the geological anomaly known as the 'Echoing Stone' formations within [Triz Valley](/geography/settlement/city/triz-valley.md). 

### Location & Appearance

The shrine manifests as a natural, subtly shifting pattern within the unique plate formations that resemble stone but are actually fragments of a hidden [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) within [Triz Valley](/geography/settlement/city/triz-valley.md). These plates are predominantly composed of layered marble, limestone, onyx, andesite and granite. 

These plates aren’s stationary - they shimmer and subtly shift position over time. When one focuses on these plates, it appears that their internal structure isn't a solid form - instead, they exhibit swirling patterns and echoing visual distortion - like looking into liquid mercury.

The most potent focal point is a section of the Echoing Stone formations near Guidepost Plaza, where particularly vibrant resonant patterns are visible. This area is marked by a subtle hum, barely audible but distinctly felt as a vibration within the bones.

### Resonance Connection

The Echoing Stone plates act as a natural amplifier and conduit for [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md), particularly sounds and vibrations. Any sound directed at the stone seems to be absorbed, then subtly re-emitted in a distorted, echoing form.  This effect grows stronger the more attuned someone is to resonance and the closer they get to the shrine.

Specific acoustic frequencies create visual patterns on the stone surface, ranging from shimmering waves to complex, geometric shapes.  Skilled resonators can use this feedback loop to amplify their own resonant abilities, even creating resonant constructs or projecting illusions.

### Worship & Rituals

There is no organized priesthood or established dogma associated with this shrine. Instead, it’s revered by various individuals and groups within [Triz Valley](/geography/settlement/city/triz-valley.md):

*   **The Harmonists:** A small sect of mystics who see the Echoing Stone as a gateway to other dimensions or planes of existence. They perform silent meditations near the formations, seeking to interpret the resonant patterns as messages from beyond.
*   **The Flatstone Family (of Or):** While maintaining a public stance of disinterest, the Flatstones subtly monitor resonant activity in the valley, believing it holds key to manipulating or harnessing geological energy – potentially enhancing mining operations or developing new technologies. They send their most adept accountants and envoys to analyse any fluctuations.
*   **Independent Resonators & Artists:** Many individuals simply utilize the shrine for its practical benefits, using it to amplify their own abilities, experiment with resonant art forms, or even as a unique acoustic space for performances.

**Common Rituals:**

*   **Echo-Chanting:** Reciting specific phrases or mantras while facing the stone, hoping to influence its resonant patterns and gain insight or power. 
*   **Resonant Sculpture:** Using specialized tools to carve or shape the Echoing Stone (a difficult and potentially dangerous process) to amplify specific resonant frequencies.
*   **Guidepost Ritual:**  During
