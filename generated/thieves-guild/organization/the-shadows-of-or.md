# The Shadows of Or

## A Guild of Subtle Influence and Calculated Risk

The Shadows of Or is the most discreet and arguably most powerful thieves' guild operating within the [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md). Unlike flashier criminal organizations, they eschew open conflict and grand heists, preferring instead to manipulate events from the shadows, exploit vulnerabilities, and profit from the city's intricate web of politics, trade, and social maneuvering.

## History and Origins

The guild's origins are shrouded in mystery, with rumors tracing back to the earliest days of Or’s founding. It is believed to have begun as a network of informants and message runners catering to the dwarf merchant clans and gradually evolved into a fully-fledged criminal enterprise. The current Grandmaster, known only as “The Weaver,” is said to have consolidated power decades ago, bringing disparate cells under a unified command and instituting a strict code of conduct focused on discretion and long-term planning.

## Structure and Hierarchy

The Shadows of Or operates with a remarkably compartmentalized structure designed to minimize risk and maintain operational security. Membership is broken down into tiers, each with specific responsibilities and levels of access to information:

*   **Whispers:** New recruits, often recruited from the lower districts, who perform mundane tasks like gathering information, delivering messages, and acting as lookouts. They have limited knowledge of the guild's true operations.
*   **Shadows:** Experienced operatives who handle more complex tasks such as pickpocketing, burglary, and sabotage. They are trained in stealth, disguise, and a variety of combat skills.
*   **Weavers:** The leadership cadre, responsible for planning and executing the guild's major operations. Each Weaver specializes in a specific area of expertise, such as espionage, finance, or assassination.
*   **The Weaver:** The ultimate authority within the Shadows of Or, responsible for setting the guild's overall strategy and ensuring its continued success. Their identity remains a closely guarded secret, known only to a handful of trusted lieutenants.

## Operations and Specializations

*   **Information Brokering:** The Shadows of Or possess an extensive network of informants throughout the city, providing them with access to valuable intelligence on political figures, merchants, and rivals. They are known for selling this information to the highest bidder.
*   **Financial Manipulation:** Skilled in accounting, forgery, and investment, the guild excels at manipulating financial markets, laundering money, and defrauding wealthy individuals.
*   **Political Intrigue:** The Shadows of Or subtly influence local politics through bribery, blackmail, and misinformation campaigns. They aim to create a favorable environment for their own interests and undermine their opponents.
*   **Discreet Acquisition:** While not known for brazen heists, the guild excels at acquiring valuable objects or information through manipulation, infiltration, or exploiting vulnerabilities in security.
*   **Counter-Espionage:** They operate a dedicated division focused on identifying and neutralizing threats to the guild's operations, including rival organizations and government investigators.

## Known Associates and Rivals

*   **Councilman Grimstone:** A corrupt city official known to receive bribes from various criminal organizations, including the Shadows of Or.
