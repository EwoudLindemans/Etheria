# The Shadow Syndicate

## A Network of Shadows

The Shadow Syndicate is the largest and most influential thieves' guild operating in the [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md) and surrounding regions. Unlike smaller, more localized gangs, the Syndicate operates as a decentralized network of cells, each with its own area of expertise and local leader (known as a 'Veil'). While no single individual commands the entire organization, a shadowy council of Veils is believed to guide overall strategy and mediate disputes.

## Structure and Cells

The Syndicate doesn't have a formal hierarchy. Instead, it’s comprised of independent Cells, each specializing in a particular aspect of criminal activity. Common Cell types include:

*   **The Whispers:** Information brokers and spies, specializing in gathering intelligence, blackmail, and manipulating key individuals.
*   **The Fingers:** Skilled pickpockets, lockpicks, and safe-crackers, responsible for acquiring valuables through stealth and cunning.
*   **The Runners:** Fast and discreet messengers, smugglers, and distributors who can move goods and people across vast distances, often utilizing hidden tunnels and secret routes.
*   **The Blades:** Combat specialists and enforcers, who are hired for protection, intimidation, and eliminating rivals.  They are highly skilled in both armed and unarmed combat.
*   **The Fabricators:** Skilled forgers, counterfeiters, and alchemists, specializing in creating fake documents, currency, and other valuable items.

Each Cell operates with considerable autonomy, contributing a portion of their earnings to a central 'Shadow Fund' used to finance Syndicate operations, bribe officials, and maintain a network of safe houses and informants.

## Leadership & The Veil Council

Direct leadership is intentionally obscured. The Shadow Fund is managed by a council of Veils—the leaders of the most successful and influential Cells. Veil meetings are held in secret locations within the Undercity and their discussions are notoriously difficult to discern.

Rumors suggest a rotating Veil-Chair which dictates short-term strategy, but the overarching aims of the Syndicate remain unclear.
