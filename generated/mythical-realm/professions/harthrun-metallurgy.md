# Harthrûn Metallurgy

[Harthrûn Metallurgy](/structure/society/profession/harthrûn-metallurgy.md) is an ancient and revered profession within dwarven society, specializing in the creation of incredibly powerful and magically-infused artifacts. It’s more than just craftsmanship; it's a spiritual calling, a blend of intricate metalworking, runic inscription, and mastery of elemental forces channeled through the mystical [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md).

## Core Principles

*   **Runic Imbuement:** Each artifact isn’t merely forged; it’s inscribed with potent runes that amplify its properties and bind the artifact to the wielder, often granting unique abilities. The runes used and their arrangement are dictated by centuries of tradition and are critical to the artifact’s power.
*   **Elemental [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md):** Harthrûn Metallurgists don't just work with metal; they attune it to the surrounding elemental forces, specifically channeling the [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md)'s elemental energy, resulting in artifacts that resonate with specific elements (fire, earth, ice, etc.).
*   **[Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md) Affinity:**  A Metallurgist’s connection to the Heartforge is paramount. The better the connection, the more easily the smith can draw upon its power. This connection is often tested and strengthened through rituals and trials.
