# The Portal Divide: Mohinders' Fractured Cityscape

## The Legacy of a Broken Promise

[Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md), once envisioned as a beacon of interconnectedness and prosperity within the Spiral, now stands as a stark example of fractured unity. Its meticulously designed portal network, intended to facilitate seamless movement and trade, has become the epicenter of a bitter power struggle. The Council, staunch proponents of order and control, and the Veilbreakers, champions of freedom and equality, have manipulated the city's magical infrastructure to erect an invisible barrier that effectively bisects Mohinders into separate, isolated territories.

The odd sensation of *seeing* the other side, yet being utterly unable to reach it, is a constant source of frustration. Homes and shops lie just beyond a street corner, their occupants visible, yet unreachable. The most common response to this bizarre situation has been the rise of an underground network of smugglers. Operating in the shadows, these illicit traders offer dangerous and unreliable
