# Elixir of Moonlit Dreams

## A Potion of Restorative Tranquility

**Category:** Healing, Mental/Emotional Support
**Subcategory:** Restorative
**Rarity:** Uncommon
**Price:** 150 gp

**Description:**

This shimmering, opalescent liquid swirls with faint silver motes, reminiscent of moonlight dancing on still water. The Elixir of Moonlit Dreams is a carefully crafted potion designed to promote deep, restful sleep and mend fractured emotional stability. It isn't a direct healing agent, but rather a powerful restorative that addresses the underlying causes of fatigue, anxiety, and emotional distress.

**Effects:**

*   **Immediate Calm:** Upon consumption, the elixir induces a wave of gentle warmth and tranquility, easing tension in the muscles and calming racing thoughts. Fear and anxiety are subtly dampened, replaced by a sense of peace.
*   **Restorative Sleep:** The primary effect of the elixir is to grant the drinker a period of exceptionally deep and restorative sleep.  The sleep granted lasts for 8 hours. Upon waking, the drinker feels refreshed and free of lingering fatigue, even after periods of extreme stress or sleep deprivation.  Nightmares are significantly suppressed.  A successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw is required to prevent vivid, but ultimately harmless, dreams filled with symbolic imagery related to the drinker's anxieties.  
*   **Emotional Mending (Limited):** While not a cure for psychological trauma, the elixir can provide temporary relief from debilitating emotional distress.  It can ease the intensity of grief, fear, or anxiety, providing a window for clearer thinking and better emotional regulation for 12 hours.  Repeated use over multiple nights can produce cumulative benefit, easing the severity of emotional burden. 

**Ingredients:**

*   **Moonglow Essence:** (Rare herb found only in areas bathed in moonlight) – 2 measures
*   **Silverleaf Bloom:** (Calming herb known for its silvery hue) – 1 measure
*   **Dreamweaver’s Tears:** (Distilled essence of Nightshade, carefully purified to remove toxins – a dangerous and complex process) – 1/4 measure
*   **Springwater Collected at Midnight:** (Water collected during the peak of the moon’s influence) – 1 cup

**Brewing Difficulty:** 14

**Potential Side Effects:**

*   **Dream Sensitivity:**  While nightmares are suppressed, the drinker may experience unusually vivid and symbolic dreams. Some individuals find these dreams unsettling, while others find them insightful. The DC 12 Wisdom saving throw prevents this.
*   **Lightheadedness:**  Upon waking, the drinker may feel slightly disoriented for a few moments. This effect fades quickly.
*   **Lunar Dependency (Rare):** In extremely rare cases, prolonged or excessive use of the elixir can lead to a mild dependence on lunar energy. The drinker may experience mild irritability or restlessness during periods of prolonged darkness. This is reversible through careful withdrawal.

**Notes:**

*   The Elixir of Moonlit Dreams is particularly useful for individuals suffering from insomnia, anxiety, or emotional trauma. It can also be beneficial for adventurers recovering from strenuous activity or mental exhaustion. 
*   This potion is favored by bards and those dedicated to arts, as it allows for deeper creative connection during dream states. 
*   The Dreamweaver’s Tears is the most difficult and dangerous ingredient to acquire, requiring expert alchemical skill and a steady hand.
