## Aethelgardian Star Maps: Guiding Navigation and Predicting the Tides

The people of Aethelgard possess a deep connection to the night sky. Living on a vast archipelago, navigation by the stars is critical for trade, exploration, and even predicting the unpredictable tides. As such, celestial cartography is a revered art, blending practical knowledge with mystical interpretation.

### Materials & Techniques

*   **Ink of Deepwater Squid:** A bioluminescent ink harvested from colossal squid found in the deepest trenches. It glows faintly, making the charts readable even on moonless nights. The color varies slightly depending on the squid's diet, offering subtle clues about ocean currents.
*   **Stone Tablets of Greywind Isle:** Smooth, porous stones from Greywind Isle are ideal for etching the charts. The stone holds the ink well and can be waterproofed with a mixture of beeswax and swamp moss.
*   **Etching Tools:** Crafted from polished obsidian, these tools are used to meticulously etch the star patterns onto the stone tablets.  Master etchers are renowned for their precision, able to render complex constellations with incredible detail.
*   **Chromatic Dust:** A rare substance collected from meteor showers, chromatic dust is sprinkled onto the charts to highlight the apparent movement of stars over long periods. Each color corresponds to a specific timeframe – fleeting blues for immediate shifts, deeper reds for decades.

### Key Constellations & Features

*   **The Serpent's Coil:** A sprawling constellation depicting a massive serpent, believed to be the guardian of the archipelago. Its position is crucial for predicting monsoon seasons – a southward shift signifies heavy rains.
*   **The Sunken Crown:** A cluster of faint stars resembling a fractured crown. Legend says it marks the location of a lost underwater kingdom.
*   **The Twin Peaks:** Two bright stars that always appear together, guiding ships safely through the treacherous reefs of the Razorback Shoals.
*   **The Astral Whale:** A constellation said to embody the migratory patterns of the colossal Leviathans that roam the ocean, serving as a warning to ships to avoid their paths.
*   **The Tide Stones:** Not a constellation per se, but a series of alignment markers on the surface of the ocean visible only at specific lunar phases.  Knowing these points is essential for understanding the complex tidal cycles.

### Schools of Celestial Interpretation

*   **The Navigators’ Guild:** Primarily focused on practical navigation. Their charts are rigorously tested and updated based on real-world experience. They emphasize accuracy and predictability.
*   **The Seer's Circle:** Believe the stars hold prophetic visions. Their charts are adorned with symbolic representations and layered meanings, seeking to interpret the future and discern the will of the ancient spirits.
*   **The Chronomasters:** Dedicate their lives to measuring the subtle shifts in the stars' positions, using this data to refine their predictions of celestial events, like eclipses and cometary passages.

###  Rare Charts and Legendary Observations

*   **The Chart of the Shifting North:** Rumored to depict a northern star that moves erratically, said to predict periods of societal upheaval.
*   **The Comet's Kiss:** A chart meticulously recording the passage of a comet visible only once every century, said to herald an age of great change.
*   **The Shadow Stars:** Ancient charts that purportedly show constellations hidden during eclipses—only visible to those with true sight—which are said to reflect the hidden depths of the mind.
