# Ornite Ring Observation Protocols

## Introduction

The [Ornite Ring](/geography/landmark/scale/ornite-ring.md) is a phenomenon unlike any other in Eldeviér.  A massive, black ring encircling the world with a perpetual, glowing red inner lining, its behavior and purpose remain largely unknown. These protocols outline standardized observation methods and data collection procedures for all researchers tasked with studying the Ring. Strict adherence is mandatory to ensure data consistency and reliability.  Deviation requires approval from the Stellar Research Council.

## Observation Stations & Equipment

* **Designated Observatories:**  Observation must occur from designated locations. These are: [Arkona](/geography/settlement/city/arkona.md), [Triz Valley](/geography/settlement/city/triz-valley.md), and a newly established remote station on the Peaks of [Morakai](/geography/continent/morakai.md).
* **Equipment:**
    * **Chromatic Scanners (Mk. III):**  Essential for analyzing the Ring's spectral composition. Regularly calibrated using standardized spectra.  Record all readings with detailed notes on environmental conditions (atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity).
    * **Temporal Displacement Probes (TDP-7):** For short-range temporal scans within the Ring's aura.  *Use with extreme caution!* Prolonged exposure to the TDP-7’s readings can result in disorientation and memory fragmentation.
    * **Aetheric [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Meters (ARM-4):** Detect fluctuations in aetheric energy surrounding the Ring.  Compare readings across different observation points to identify potential spatial anomalies.
    * **Recording Devices (Standardized):** All audio and visual data must be recorded on standardized units to facilitate analysis and archival.

## Observation Schedules

* **Daily Observation (All Stations):**  Four observation periods: Sunrise, Midday, Sunset, Midnight. Record visual intensity, color variations, and any unusual patterns.
* **Lunar Cycle Observation (All Stations):**  Detailed observations are required during each lunar phase. Emphasis on correlating lunar cycles with Ring activity.
* **Solstice/Equinox Observation (All Stations):**  Intensified observation periods during Solstices and Equinoxes, as these times have historically shown increased Ring activity.
* **Irregular Observation (As Directed by Stellar Research Council):**  Supplemental observations triggered by detected anomalies or specific research requests.

## Data Recording & Analysis

* **Standardized Forms:** Utilize the pre-approved data recording forms, available digitally and in print.  No freeform notes are permitted.
* **Spectral Analysis:**  All spectral readings must be correlated with the Stellar Codex of Spectral Signatures.
* **Temporal Drift Analysis:** TDP-7 readings are to be carefully analyzed for signs of temporal distortion.  Document any discrepancies between readings taken at slightly different times.
* **Aetheric Fluctuations:** Note any unusual spikes or patterns in Aetheric [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Meter readings. Correlate with atmospheric conditions.
* **Cross-Station Data Comparison:** Regularly compare data from different observation stations to identify potential biases and confirm observations.
* **Anomaly Reporting:**  Any unexplained phenomena or deviations from established patterns must be reported immediately to the Stellar Research Council.

## Safety Protocols

* **Aetheric Shielding:** All observation stations are equipped with aetheric shielding.  Ensure it is functioning correctly before commencing observations.
* **Temporal Stability Gear:** Required for all personnel operating TDP-7 devices.  Regularly inspect for damage.
* **Environmental Monitoring:** Continuously monitor environmental conditions at observation stations.  Report any hazardous situations immediately.
* **Emergency Evacuation Procedures:** Familiarize yourself with emergency evacuation procedures for each observation station.
* **Restricted Areas:** Areas around active TDP-7 experiments are restricted. Unauthorized personnel are prohibited.

## Addendum

* **Ring Echoes:** Recent observations indicate the potential for brief “echoes” within the Ring, displaying imagery of events from Eldeviér's distant past.  These are extremely rare and require immediate reporting.  Attempting to “capture” these echoes is strictly prohibited due to potential temporal instability.

* **The Silent Watchers:** Theories surrounding the Ring suggest potential observers or entities beyond our understanding. Maintain vigilance and report any suspected encounters, however improbable.
