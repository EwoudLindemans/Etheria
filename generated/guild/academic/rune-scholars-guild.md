# Rune Scholars Guild

## Preserving Knowledge, Unlocking Secrets

The Rune Scholars Guild is the preeminent organization dedicated to the study, preservation, and application of runic lore within the [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md) and across [Iridia](/geography/cosmology/iridia.md). Stemming directly from the foundation of [Runehollow Hall](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/runehollow-hall.md), the Guild has maintained an unbroken lineage of scholars, translators, and runic artisans for centuries. Membership is highly selective, requiring both exceptional intellect and demonstrable skill in deciphering and manipulating runes.

## History & Founding

The Guild's origins are deeply intertwined with the establishment of [Runehollow Hall](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/runehollow-hall.md). Following the rediscovery of ancient runic texts and the desire to safeguard the city's history, [Or Flatstone](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/or-flatstone.md) himself chartered the first cohort of scholars, tasking them with cataloging, translating, and researching the power inherent within runes. Over time, this informal group solidified into a formal Guild, gaining considerable political influence and academic prestige.
