# Fleet of the Gluttthar Ogres

## A Gentle Might Upon the Mistveil

The [Ogres of Glutt’thar](/structure/society/ogres-of-glutt-thar.md), renowned for their quiet artistry and deep connection to the **[Mistveil Marshes](/geography/region/mistveil-marshes.md)**, are not immediately associated with naval power. However, their intimate knowledge of the swamp and their patient mastery of mudshaping extend surprisingly to the waterways that crisscross their misty home. While not a military force seeking conquest, the Glutt’thar maintain a unique and vital fleet – the 'Murksong Fleet' – primarily focused on trade, transportation, and the delicate protection of the marshes’ fragile ecosystem.

Unlike the gleaming, heavily armored vessels favored by nations like [Scholar’s Rift](/geography/settlement/enclave/scholars-rift/scholars-rift.md) and the aggressive longships of the northern raiders, the Murksong Fleet embodies the Glutt’thar’s philosophy of harmony and slow strength. Their ships aren’t built so much as *grown*, utilizing a blend of carefully shaped marsh clay, interwoven reeds, and resilient swampwood. This organic construction grants them incredible stability in the unpredictable waterways, allowing them to navigate the submerged logs, sudden shallows, and dense fog with ease.

## Vessels of the Murksong Fleet

The fleet’s composition reflects its peaceful purpose, prioritizing practicality and a low environmental impact.

*   **Mudscrapers:** These are the workhorses of the fleet - broad, flat-bottomed barges used for transporting large quantities of clay, reeds, and other materials for construction and crafting within the marshes. They’re exceptionally stable and require minimal maintenance, capable of carrying immense loads. Some are even designed with integrated workshops, allowing [Mudshapers](/structure/society/profession/mudshaper.md) to continue their craft while underway.
*   **Reedsail Skiffs:** Smaller, maneuverable vessels used for individual travel and exploration. These skiffs are remarkably swift, propelled by large, intricately woven reed sails that catch the slightest breeze. Their shallow drafts allow them to navigate the narrowest channels and access hidden corners of the marsh.
*   **Bog-Striders:** Large, semi-submerged platforms crafted from interconnected clay and reeds. These act as mobile marketplaces and gathering places, allowing the Glutt’thar to trade and share knowledge with neighboring communities. They're often adorned with intricate clay carvings depicting the spirits of the marsh.
*   **The Gloomwood Wardens:** The Fleet’s only
