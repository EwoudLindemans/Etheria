# Dwarven Ironclad

## A Mountain on the Waves

The Dwarven Ironclad is a marvel of engineering, representing the pinnacle of Dwarven naval technology. Constructed from layers of reinforced iron plates, infused with rune-forged steel, and reinforced with granite bracing, these vessels are nearly impervious to conventional naval weaponry.

### Design & Construction

*   **Hull:** Multi-layered iron plates reinforced with granite and rune-etched steel, providing exceptional armor. A double hull design provides a degree of protection against hull breaches.
*   **Size:** Significantly larger than most surface vessels, typically around 150-200 feet long and 60-80 feet wide.
*   **Draft:** Deep draft (15-20 feet), limiting maneuverability but increasing stability.
*   **Propulsion:** Primarily rely on powerful, steam-powered paddlewheels reinforced with dwarven metal alloys, capable of impressive speeds despite their size. Emergency bellows-powered secondary system in case of steam failure.
*   **Crew:** Requires a large crew of 200-300 dwarves, including engineers, gunners, stokers, and navigators.

### Armament

The Dwarven Ironclad is a floating fortress, heavily armed with a variety of weaponry:

*   **Main Batteries:** Six to eight 18-inch rune-forged cannons mounted on rotating turrets. These cannons fire massive, armor-piercing rounds capable of disabling or sinking enemy vessels.
*   **Secondary Batteries:** Numerous 10-inch cannons flanking the main batteries provide additional firepower against smaller vessels and fortifications.
*   **Anti-Fighter/Raid Platforms:** Several platforms around the upper deck for lightly armored, rune-powered crossbows and ballistae used against aerial threats and raiding parties.
*   **Ram:** A reinforced iron ram at the bow, designed to cripple or sink enemy ships through sheer force.

### Defenses

*   **Armor:** Exceptional armor protects against most conventional naval weaponry.
*   **Rune Shields:** Limited-range rune shields can be projected from the vessel to deflect incoming projectiles, though prolonged use drains significant magical power.
*   **Internal Fire Suppression:** Internal fire-fighting systems, including pressurized water jets and automated blast doors, mitigate the risk of internal fires.
*   **Reinforced Bulkheads:** Internally compartmentalized with reinforced bulkheads to limit the spread of damage.

### Strengths

*   **Exceptional Armor:** Virtually invulnerable to most naval cannons.
*   **Massive Firepower:** Devastating offensive capabilities.
*   **High Stability:** Resistant to rolling and pitching in rough seas.
*   **Long Endurance:**  The steam systems are notoriously efficient.

### Weaknesses

*   **Slow Speed:** Large size and deep draft limit maneuverability and speed.
*   **Vulnerability to Boarding:** The many interior chambers and narrow corridors are difficult to defend against a boarding action.
*   **Magical Vulnerability:** Although physically resilient, rune shields require magical power, making them vulnerable to anti-[magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) fields or powerful magical attacks.
*   **Expensive to Build & Maintain:**  Requires vast resources and skilled dwarven engineers to construct and maintain.

### Notable Vessels

*   *Mountain's Fury* - Flagship of the Dwarven Royal Fleet.
*   *Stonebreaker* - Known for sinking an Elven dreadnought in a legendary battle.
