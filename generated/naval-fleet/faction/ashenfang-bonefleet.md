# The Ashenfang Bonefleet: Vessels of Desolation

The [Ashenfang](/structure/society/clan/ashenfang.md) Bonefleet is no conventional navy. It represents a chilling adaptation to the environment of the Skein, a terrifying [manifestation](/structure/chronological/event/manifestation.md) of the Ashenfang's dominion over death and bonecraft. Rather than building ships of wood or metal, they construct spectral vessels animated by stolen souls and reinforced with petrified bone, representing a singular and deeply unsettling expression of their power.

## Fleet Composition & Vessels

The [Ashenfang](/structure/society/clan/ashenfang.md) Bonefleet is a patchwork collection of horrifying constructs. Standardization is practically nonexistent, a consequence of the scavenging nature of the Ashenfang and the unpredictable energies of the Skein. However, certain vessel types have emerged as dominant, each designed to exploit specific tactical advantages.

### *The Ribcrawlers*:

The backbone (literally) of the fleet are the Ribcrawlers. These colossal platforms are constructed from the fossilized ribs of colossal Skein beasts – remnants of creatures long extinct, now repurposed as floating fortresses. Ribcrawlers are incredibly resilient, shrugging off conventional weaponry with ease. Their upper decks are crowded with bonebound archers, soul-spewers (cannons that fire solidified spectral energy), and platforms for summoning skeletal servitors. The largest Ribcrawlers can even host minor Bone Wardens, acting as mobile command centers.

### *The Wraith Skimmers*:

For swift raiding and reconnaissance, the [Ashenfang](/structure/society/clan/ashenfang.md) employ Wraith Skimmers. These vessels are crafted from a framework of black bone, interwoven with spectral threads, allowing them to glide across the Skein's waters with unsettling silence. Powered by bound wraiths, they are incredibly fast, though lightly armored. Their primary armament consists of Soul Nets, capable of capturing spirits and disrupting enemy formations, and 'Ghostfire' projectors, capable of burning flesh and binding souls.

### *The Ossuary Barges*:

Logistical support in a conventional navy relies on cargo ships. For the [Ashenfang](/structure/society/clan/ashenfang.md), these take the form of Ossuary Barges – vast, floating necropolises. Constructed from stacks of petrified bones and reinforced with spectral bindings, these barges are practically indestructible. They transport skeletal servitors, necromantic reagents, captured souls, and the disassembled components for new vessels, often requiring a skeletal crew to maintain the machinery and fight off scavengers. The skeletal crew are bound to the barge with rituals.

### *The Husk Drakes*:

Rare and exceptionally disturbing, Husk Drakes are aerial vessels resembling skeletal dragons. Built around a skeletal frame, these winged monstrosities are powered by bound wind spirits and shrouded in a veil of spectral smoke. They primarily serve as aerial scouts and terror weapons, capable of dropping Soul Bombs—containers of concentrated spectral energy—onto enemy vessels and settlements. These ships are seen as omens.

## Fleet Tactics & Doctrine

The [Ashenfang](/structure/society/clan/ashenfang.md) Bonefleet’s doctrine prioritizes attrition and spiritual disruption over swift, decisive engagements. Their tactics are characterized by:

*   **Soul Bleed:** Constant bombardment with Soul Nets and Ghostfire projectors to weaken enemy vessels and drain their morale.
*   **Attrition Warfare:** The Bonefleet can absorb tremendous damage, designed to outlast the aggressor.
*   **Phantom Assaults:** Wraith Skimmers launch hit-and-run attacks, sowing confusion and fear before vanishing into the mists.
*   **Spiritual Corruption:** The mere presence of the Bonefleet is psychologically damaging, invoking feelings of dread and despair in those who witness it.

## Connection to Ashenfang Culture and the Skein

The Bonefleet is more than just a military force – it's a tangible expression of the [Ashenfang](/structure/society/clan/ashenfang.md)'s worldview. Every vessel is a testament to their power over life and death, and their ability to reshape the Skein to their own ends. The materials used, the souls bound within, and the rituals performed during construction all reflect the Ashenfang's connection to [Skul'Kruk](/being/titan/skul-kruk.md) and their mastery of necromantic art.

The skeletal nature of the fleet is not merely aesthetic; it is a practical response to the scarcity of resources in the Skein. The [Ashenfang](/structure/society/clan/ashenfang.md) scavenge the remains of forgotten creatures and repurpose them into instruments of war. This symbiotic relationship between the Bonefleet and the Skein ensures the fleet's continued existence, even as it spreads desolation across the water.

## Strategic Implications

The [Ashenfang](/structure/society/clan/ashenfang.md) Bonefleet presents a unique and terrifying challenge to any navy. Their ability to withstand punishment, disrupt enemy morale, and utilize the environment to their advantage makes them a formidable opponent. Conventional naval tactics often prove ineffective against the Bonefleet, requiring specialized strategies and countermeasures to mitigate their threats. Any navy that wishes to stand against the Ashenfang must be prepared for a war of attrition, a battle not just of ships and weapons, but of wills and souls.
