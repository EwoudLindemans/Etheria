# Dustfall

Dustfall is a fledgling village clinging to existence on the western edge of the Rendishing Desert, a few days’ travel from the Momentus Outpost and within easy reach of the mysterious, newly constructed Shinging Well. Founded barely a year ago by a small band of prospectors and those seeking a fresh start, it's a harsh place to carve out a life, but the promise of untapped resources and a sense of independence have drawn a diverse, if wary, population.

## A Village of Opportunity and Risk

Dustfall’s initial growth stemmed from rumors of mineral deposits found near the Shinging Well. Though the mineral wealth hasn't materialized as expected, the presence of [the well](/geography/landmark/the-well.md) has proven invaluable. The constant need for runners between the well and the outpost – individuals skilled in dodging the rumored beast lurking near its depths – has become a vital and relatively lucrative trade. Prospectors still arrive, hoping to strike it rich, while others, drawn by the need for labor, seek employment as runners or help construct and maintain the village's infrastructure.

## The Shinging Well's Shadow

Life in Dustfall is inextricably linked to the Shinging Well. [The well](/geography/landmark/the-well.md)'s sudden appearance, seemingly from nowhere, remains a source of both hope and unease. While it provides a crucial water source and has fueled the village's growth, the terrifying stories about the creature guarding it continue to spread.  Runners, constantly risking their lives, are regarded with a mixture of respect and apprehension. The village has become accustomed to brief shortages and a palpable tension, knowing the next delivery of water might not arrive.

## A Crossroads of Strange Encounters

The village's proximity to [the well](/geography/landmark/the-well.md) and its unusual appearance has also attracted the attention of…others. Rumors of strange lights seen near the well at night, fleeting glimpses of non-human figures, and unsettling dreams amongst the inhabitants circulate in hushed tones. Some whisper of planar rifts and echoes of other worlds bleeding through, possibly linked to the [Invisible Stalker](/being/monster/invisible-stalker.md) mentioned by local lore.

Occasionally, travelers who’re not related to water come passing by; most of them are looking for the ruins of ancient civilization lost in the sands. Few of them have found anything. Some believe Dustfall sits atop a layer of lost knowledge. But none have been able to proof it.

## Village Structure

Dustfall is laid out in a somewhat haphazard fashion around a central well-house, which serves as both a water distribution point and a makeshift town hall. Buildings are constructed primarily from sun-baked clay and salvaged materials, offering little protection from the desert's extreme temperatures. A few weathered tents mark the dwellings of nomadic traders who pass through the village, bringing goods from distant settlements.
