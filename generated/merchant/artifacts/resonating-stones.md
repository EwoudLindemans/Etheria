Resonating Stones are a unique geological phenomenon prevalent throughout the Undercity and the deeper levels of Or. They’re not gemstones in the traditional sense; rather, they're naturally occurring rock formations, often quartz-based, that possess a faint, persistent [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md)—a hum felt rather than heard—linked to the Undercity's overall resonance field. The potency and character of this resonance varies wildly, linked to the surrounding stone composition, the proximity to significant structural features (such as old tunnels or ancient ley lines), and their age.

**Origin:** Formed over millennia as the Undercity’s infrastructure shifted and the city's [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) field solidified. Old tunnels, forgotten rituals, and concentrated [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) all contribute to their formation.

**Appearance:** Varies wildly in color and shape. They are most often found in dark gray, mottled shades, but can be found exhibiting streaks of emerald green (linked to ancient fungal colonies), vibrant blue (possibly traces of forgotten elemental [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md)), or shimmering gold (suggesting proximity to particularly stable ley lines). Sizes range from pebble-sized fragments to palm-sized nodules. They are generally cold to the touch and possess a subtle, almost imperceptible vibration when held.

**Properties & Uses:**

*   **Enhancement of [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md):** Primarily used to amplify or channel the Undercity's existing resonance. Skilled stonemasons and resonators use them to reinforce structural foundations, stabilize collapsing tunnels, or power rudimentary resonance-based mechanisms.
*   **Minor Magical Amplification:** Some stones exhibit a subtle amplification effect on certain types of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), particularly those related to earth, stone, or vibration. Mages occasionally seek them out to subtly enhance their casting or imbue items with minor resonant properties.
*   **Ritual Components:** Priests of the Deep Ward utilize the stones in warding rituals to strengthen protective barriers and repel unwanted entities.
*   **Personal Mediation:** Some individuals find that holding a specific stone provides a sense of calm and clarity, helping them focus their thoughts and maintain emotional stability in the often-chaotic Undercity.
