Soul-Silk is a unique and highly sought-after trade good exclusively produced by the reclusive elven Dreamweavers of the Silverwood. It isn't woven from ordinary fibers, but rather carefully coaxed from the residual magical [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) left behind by particularly vivid dreams. Harvesting this resonance is a delicate art, requiring intricate rituals and a deep understanding of the dreamscape's ephemeral nature.

## The Process: Echoes in the Weave

Dreamweavers enter a shared meditative state, collectively experiencing and meticulously recording exceptional dreams—often those reflecting strong emotions, prophetic visions, or significant moments in elven history. Once a suitable dream is selected, they utilize specialized looms crafted from dreamwood – a rare, magically-attuned wood – and painstakingly draw out the lingering [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md). This resonance manifests as shimmering, opalescent threads of varying colors and textures, each representing a specific facet of the dream's emotional landscape.

These threads, once stabilized, are then woven into exquisite tapestries, garments, or intricate accessories. The resulting Soul-Silk retains echoes of the original dream, subtly influencing the wearer or observer in ways both profound and unsettling.

## Properties & Effects

*   **Emotional [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md):** Soul-Silk doesn't grant overt magical powers but instead subtly amplifies existing emotions. A tapestry woven with a dream of courage might bolster the wearer's resolve, while one woven with a dream of sorrow might induce melancholy.
*   **Dream Recall:** Prolonged exposure to Soul-Silk, particularly in the form of garments or accessories, can subtly enhance dream recall. Wearers may find themselves remembering forgotten details of past dreams or experiencing unusually vivid dreams of their own.
*   **Aura of Memory:** Soul-Silk emanates a faint aura of memory, allowing skilled psychics or those attuned to the dreamscape to glimpse fragments of the original dream woven into the fabric. This makes it a prized ingredient in dream research and divination rituals.
*   **Subtle Illusion:** Depending on the woven dream, Soul-Silk can create fleeting, almost imperceptible illusions—a whisper of laughter, a shimmer of light, a hint of a forgotten face.
