# Resonators of Coalwalk

## Fine Instruments from the Heart of the City

Resonators of Coalwalk is a unique instrument-making shop nestled in the vibrant, hard-working district of [Coalwalk Row](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/coalwalk-row.md), [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md). Founded by the renowned dwarven artisan Bryn Stonebeard, the shop specializes in crafting sturdy, resonating instruments suited for the rough-and-tumble life of the city and drawing inspiration from its industrial heart.

## A Distinctive Style

Unlike the delicate, finely-crafted instruments found in the wealthier districts of the city, Resonators of Coalwalk’s creations are built for durability and volume. They prioritize a raw, powerful sound that cuts through the clatter of the city. The instruments incorporate scavenged forge iron, resonant stone mined from the surrounding mountains (often sourced directly from Coalwalk’s own miners), and surprisingly complex mechanisms incorporating repurposed components from old Deepforge machinery. Bryn’s designs have an unmistakable industrial edge.

## Specialty Instruments

*   **Stone-Singer Drums:** Large, hand-carved drums crafted from resonant Coalwalk stone. Known for their deep, booming tones and ability to withstand heavy use. Favored by the rowdy crowds at Tenbrew House. 
*   **Forge-Horn Trumpets:** Brass and iron trumpets that project sound with surprising clarity and volume. These are frequently used in town crier duties but are also popular among miners for signalling in the Deepforge.  Bryn utilizes a unique bellows system involving repurposed Deepforge pistons to achieve a remarkable projection.
*   **Rumble-Strings:** A type of lute/mandolin that combines wood, iron, and cleverly strung [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) plates.  The strings themselves are often spun with metal fibers to amplify the sound. They have a distinctive, somewhat metallic timbre, suited for rousing tavern songs.
*   **Echo-Flutes:** Simple flutes crafted from hollowed-out stone, designed with carefully placed internal chambers to amplify and distort sound, creating echoing effects. Popular among children and street performers in [Coalwalk Row](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/coalwalk-row.md).
