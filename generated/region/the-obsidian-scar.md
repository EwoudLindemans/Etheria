# The Obsidian Scar

Within the rugged expanse of [Morakai](/geography/continent/morakai.md), far north of the sprawling [Triz Valley](/geography/settlement/city/triz-valley.md), lies a region marked by an unnatural darkness and geological anomaly known as the Obsidian Scar. It is a desolate, volcanic plateau carved into the landscape, perpetually shrouded in a veil of ash and shadow. The region is avoided by most, whispered about in taverns as a cursed land, and only hardy prospectors and desperate scavengers venture within its bleak borders.

## Geological Formation & Hazards

The Scar's formation is unique, even within [Morakai](/geography/continent/morakai.md)'s already diverse geological tapestry. It is believed to have been created by a sudden and catastrophic release of subterranean magical energy centuries ago – an event that drastically altered the local terrain. Molten rock, charged with raw, volatile [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), erupted onto the surface, instantly petrifying into a vast expanse of black, glassy obsidian. The ensuing magical fallout continues to seep from the rock, causing unpredictable shifts in the local environment. 

*   **Obsidian Shards:** The ground is littered with razor-sharp obsidian shards, making travel treacherous. Many have been wounded, or worse, by simply traversing the Scar.
*   **Residual [Magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md):** The air itself crackles with unstable magical energy.  Random surges of elemental forces are common - sudden bursts of intense heat, chilling winds, and even localized distortions of gravity.
*   **The Ashfall:** A perpetual layer of fine, volcanic ash covers the region, obscuring vision and infiltrating every crevice. Inhaling the ash is known to cause lingering respiratory issues and, in extreme cases, madness.

## The Ashkin

The most notable inhabitants of the Obsidian Scar are the Ashkin – a hardy and reclusive folk who have adapted to the harsh environment. They are rumored to be descendants of [Morakai](/geography/continent/morakai.md)'s first settlers who sought refuge in the Scar during a long-forgotten war, taking with them lost knowledge and techniques. 

*   **Appearance:** Ashkin are known for their ashen skin, dark, often silver-tinged hair, and eyes that glow faintly in the dim light. 
*   **Society:** The Ashkin are primarily miners and scavengers, extracting rare minerals and artifacts from the Scar's depths. They live in small, fortified settlements carved into the obsidian cliffs and fiercely protect their secrets and resources.  They are deeply suspicious of outsiders and rarely engage in trade, except for the exchange of meticulously crafted obsidian tools and weaponry. 
*   **Runes:** The Ashkin have developed a unique and intricate system of magical runes carved into obsidian that seemingly harness and control some of the regions residual [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md). They are rumored to create items and wards of immense power. 

## Connection to Existing Lore

*   **The [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md):** Reports of the Arcane Fangs activity have increased around the Obsidian Scar recently, suggesting they are interested in extracting some of the regions unique resources. The Fangs have been observed attempting to infiltrate Ashkin settlements.
*   **The Runes of the Ashkin:** The Sisterhood of Assassination believes the runic knowledge of the Ashkin could be key to creating new techniques, and might seek to manipulate or infiltrate the isolated tribes.
*   **Gorgaths Wrath:** Whispers among the lower ranks within Gorgaths Wrath suggest the Flatstone dynasty knows of a relic hidden within the Scar and might task agents with obtaining it.

## Notable Locations

*   **The Black Bastion:** A massive, naturally formed obsidian spire that serves as a central hub for the Ashkin settlements.
*   **The Veins of Sorrow:** A network of deep, volcanic tunnels said to contain rare and powerful minerals, as well as dangerous creatures and traps.
*   **The Echoing Chasm:** A vast, bottomless chasm said to be a source of the regions unstable magical energy. Local legend claims that the Chasm is a pathway to [the Dense](/geography/cosmology/plane-of-existance/the-dense.md).
