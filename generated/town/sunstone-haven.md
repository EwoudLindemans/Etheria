# Sunstone Haven

## A Bastion of Trade on the Asara Plate

Sunstone Haven is a bustling trade town nestled directly beneath the eastern overhang of the [Asara Plate](/geography/landmark/scale/asara-plate.md). Its strategic location on a vital trade route, connecting [Morakai](/geography/continent/morakai.md) and [Xaratius](/geography/continent/xaratius.md), has fueled its growth from a small outpost to a significant economic hub. The town's name originates from the unique, sun-reflecting properties of the blue crystal formations covering the Asara Plate. During sunrise and sunset, these crystals blaze with an intense, golden light, casting a warm glow over the town and lending it an ethereal beauty.  The reflection also creates unusual optical illusions, which local artisans have cleverly incorporated into their crafts.

## History & Governance

Founded just over a century ago by a consortium of merchants seeking to exploit the security and natural protection afforded by the [Asara Plate](/geography/landmark/scale/asara-plate.md), Sunstone Haven initially operated as a semi-autonomous trading post. However, with its growing prosperity, the town established a council of elected representatives - the 'Gemstone Council' - to manage its affairs.  The Council is comprised of delegates from the various merchant guilds and artisan collectives, ensuring a diverse range of voices are heard.  Despite this democratic structure, whispers of corruption and manipulation within the Council persist, often fueled by rumors of involvement from the [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md), who seek to exploit the Asara Plate's unique magical properties for their own gain.

## Economy & Trade

The town's economy revolves almost entirely around trade. Caravans from [Morakai](/geography/continent/morakai.md) and [Xaratius](/geography/continent/xaratius.md) converge here, exchanging goods such as ore, textiles, livestock, and exotic spices. Sunstone Haven acts as a central marketplace and warehousing hub, offering secure storage within the natural protection of the [Asara Plate](/geography/landmark/scale/asara-plate.md). Skilled artisans thrive here, crafting intricate jewelry and decorative items using the unique, sun-refracted crystals harvested from the plate's surface.  The best crystal crafters often work directly with the Gemstone Council, creating ceremonial pieces for official functions.  The merchants rely on the roads running under and beside the plate, many have invested in securing safe passage and escorting goods, this has allowed trade to flourish within the region.
