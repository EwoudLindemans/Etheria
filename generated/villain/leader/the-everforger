## A Fallen Heartforged & Architect of Ruin
![everforger.jpg](/world/everforger.jpg = 600x)
Malakor Stonehand, known throughout the shattered lands as the Everforger, was once one of Or's most celebrated **Heartforged**, a master smith and devoted follower of Thalgrin. However, a thirst for power, coupled with a profound sense of injustice at the strictures of traditional Dwarven craft, led him down a path of forbidden knowledge and ultimately, corruption. Now, he seeks to reshape the world in his image, using twisted Scaleforged creations and armies of corrupted dwarves.

### **History & Corruption:**

Malakor initially sought to unlock the 'true potential' of Scaleforged Ores, believing that the traditional methods of tempering and bonding arcane energy were holding them back. His experiments grew increasingly reckless, pushing beyond the limits prescribed by the Codex of the Heartflame and ignoring the warnings of his mentors. He became obsessed with finding a way to *infuse* Scaleforged Ore with the raw power of the [Dense](/world/the_dense.md), bypassing the need for careful manipulation and relying on brute force. 

During one particularly volatile experiment, he tapped into a resonance of aberrant energy leaking from the fractured Scalewrought Veins near the ruined city of Aethelgard. This corrupting force warped his mind and body, transforming him into a monstrous parody of his former self and granting him unnatural abilities.

He blames the rigid traditions of Or and Thalgrin himself for his fall, viewing the god's tenets as shackles on creativity and innovation. He sees himself as a visionary, forging a new era of power and progress, regardless of the cost.

### **Appearance & Abilities:**

*   **Visage:** Malakor's body is a grotesque fusion of flesh and Scaleforged metal. His skin is etched with glowing, pulsating veins of corrupted resonance. One of his arms has completely transformed into a massive, animated hammer of black iron, capable of shattering stone and absorbing magical energy. His eyes glow with an unsettling emerald fire.
*   **Corrupted Scaleforging:** Malakor can manipulate Scaleforged Ores with unprecedented speed and power, shaping them into grotesque constructs and weaponry imbued with chaotic magic.  He doesn’s bind the power into the ore; he *commands* it.
*   **Resonance Absorption:** He can absorb ambient resonance and even drain it from Scaleforged items, weakening opponents and empowering his own creations.
*   **Construct Command:** He commands legions of corrupted dwarves and monstrous constructs made of Scaleforged Ore, known as **Stonebound Legions**.
*   **Hammer of Ruin:** His animated hammer arm can unleash devastating shockwaves and absorb magical attacks, converting them into power for himself.

### **Motivations & Goals:**

*   **Redefine Craftsmanship:** Malakor seeks to dismantle the traditional Dwarven understanding of Scaleforging, replacing it with his own twisted philosophy based on brute force and unchecked power.
*   **Revenge on Or:** He aims to subjugate the city of Or and force its artisans to serve his vision, shattering their faith in Thalgrin and imposing his rule.
*   **Unleash the Power of the Dense:** He believes that the raw power of the [Dense](/world/the_dense.md) is the key to unlocking limitless potential, and seeks to harness it to reshape the world according to his design.
*   **Create the Eternal Forge:** Malakor plans to build a massive, world-spanning forge powered by the energy of the Dense, capable of endlessly creating monstrous constructs and weaponry—a monument to his twisted legacy.

### **Weaknesses:**

*   **Disruption of Resonance:** Disrupting the flow of resonance within his constructs and armor can temporarily weaken his powers.
*   **Faith of the Heartforged:** Malakor's power is diminished in the presence of true, unwavering faith in Thalgrin and the tenets of the Heartforged.
*   **Vulnerability to Pure Resonance:**  While he can absorb corrupted resonance, pure, uncorrupted resonance can disrupt his control and inflict grievous harm.

### **Possible Encounters:**

*   **The Stonebound Incursion:** Malakor’s legions attack a Dwarven outpost, forcing the players to defend against waves of corrupted constructs.
*   **The Corrupted Forge:** The players must infiltrate Malakor's newly built, enormous forge, a labyrinth of Scaleforged horrors and deadly traps.
*   **A Plea from a Fallen Heartforged:** A former apprentice of Malakor, now imprisoned within his fortress, begs the players for help in stopping his former mentor.
*   **The Echoes of Thalgrin:** Players must seek out ancient Dwarven artifacts and rituals that resonate with the true power of Thalgrin, to gain an advantage against Malakor and his legions.
