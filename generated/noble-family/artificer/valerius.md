## History & Origins

According to family lore, Master Alaric Valerius wasn't born a noble. He was a brilliant, but penniless, craftsman who lived in the bustling industrial district of [City Name]. His early inventions—self-winding clocks, automated looms, and intricate mechanical toys—earned him a small but devoted following. His breakthrough came with the creation of the 'Aetherium Regulator,' a device that allowed for more efficient harnessing of aetheric energy, significantly improving the power of magical constructs and enabling previously impossible feats of engineering. The King, recognizing the device's immense potential, bestowed upon Alaric the title of Baron and granted him lands, establishing House Valerius.
