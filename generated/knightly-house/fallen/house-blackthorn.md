# House Blackthorn: The Fallen Briar

## A Legacy of Thorns and Betrayal

House Blackthorn was once one of the most respected and feared houses within the realm of Aeridor. Renowned for their mastery of battlefield maneuverability, their impenetrable defense lines, and their mastery of thorny [magics](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), they were the guardians of the southern border and the pride of the Sun King’s armies. They bore the sigil of a blackthorn bush intertwined with a shattered sunstone, a symbol that now carries a heavy weight of shame.

Their rise to prominence was sudden. During the Great Goblin Wars, the Blackthorns displayed unparalleled tactical brilliance, breaking several goblin offensives and securing crucial territories. It was whispered that they possessed secrets of ancient earth-[magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), allowing them to manipulate the very terrain to their advantage. However, their glory proved short-lived, culminating in the infamous 'Sunstone Treachery'.

## The Sunstone Treachery

During the coronation of the young Sun King Alaric, House Blackthorn was entrusted with safeguarding the Sunstone, a relic believed to grant prosperity and vitality to the realm. Lord Kaelen Blackthorn, then the head of the house, orchestrated a daring and devastating coup. Under the guise of a ceremonial blessing, he attempted to seize the Sunstone and crown himself as the new ruler.  

Though the coup failed – thanks to the swift actions of loyalist knights – the damage was irreparable. The Sunstone was shattered, its power diminished. Lord Kaelen was publicly executed, and House Blackthorn was stripped of its lands, titles, and honors. They were declared *fallen* and banished to the desolate Black Mire, a swamp bordering the Shadowfen, where the thorns grow long and the sun rarely shines.

## Current State & Remaining Members

Now, House Blackthorn exists as a shadow of its former self. Scattered remnants of the family reside in the Black Mire, eking out a meager existence.  They are branded as traitors and shunned by most civilized folk.  Rumors persist of a small band of loyalists desperately trying to restore their honor, while others claim the remaining Blackthorns have embraced dark [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and seek revenge on the Sun King’s dynasty.
