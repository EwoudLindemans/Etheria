# The Ossified Hand

## Specialized in Retrieval and Grave Robbing

The Ossified Hand is a notoriously discreet and effective mercenary company specializing in retrieval of lost or stolen artifacts, exploration of ancient ruins, and, less honorably, grave robbing. While they accept contracts of various kinds, their expertise lies in navigating perilous environments, deciphering cryptic clues, and overcoming magical or undead guardians to recover valuable items or information. They have a reputation for being meticulous, resourceful, and utterly ruthless when necessary.

### History & Origins

Founded roughly a century ago by the enigmatic sorceress, Lyra Blackwood (long since vanished), the company initially consisted of a small group of archivists, scholars, and adventurers who sought to unravel the secrets of forgotten civilizations. As demand for their skills grew, the group expanded, incorporating skilled warriors, trappers, and mages. Lyra's original emphasis on knowledge and careful excavation has somewhat faded, replaced by a more pragmatic, results-oriented approach – though a core of scholars still remain.

### Structure & Hierarchy

The company is structured around a strict but adaptable hierarchy:

*   **The Curator (Leader):** Currently, the position is held by Silas Thorne, a former royal archivist with a reputation for icy composure and a surprisingly strategic mind. He oversees all operations, negotiates contracts, and makes the final decisions.
*   **The Excavators (Lieutenants):**  Typically, experienced adventurers or mages who specialize in particular areas like ancient languages, trap disarming, or necromantic combat. They lead specific teams and are responsible for planning and executing retrieval operations.
*   **The Diggers (Rank and File):** The bulk of the company, composed of skilled warriors, scouts, trappers, and specialists. They handle the heavy lifting and direct confrontation during retrieval operations.
*   **The Keepers (Support Staff):**  A smaller group responsible for maintaining equipment, translating documents, and handling logistics.

### Specializations & Tactics

The Ossified Hand prides itself on a few key specializations:

*   **Ruin Navigation:** Their experts are adept at charting perilous ruins, bypassing traps, and identifying structural weaknesses.
*   **Undead Combat:** A significant portion of their contracts involve facing undead guardians. They employ a combination of magical attacks, specialized weaponry, and ritualistic suppression techniques to deal with them.
*   **Decryption & Translation:** The company employs several skilled linguists and cryptographers who can decipher ancient texts and translate cryptic clues.
*   **Trap Disarming & Mitigation:** Their trappers are masters of identifying, disarming, and mitigating traps – both magical and mechanical.

Their tactics emphasize methodical planning, reconnaissance, and calculated risk. They avoid unnecessary confrontations and prioritize preserving their equipment and personnel.

### Equipment & Resources

The Ossified Hand maintains a surprisingly extensive array of equipment, including:

*   **Reinforced Digging Tools:** Shovels, picks, and other tools crafted from rare metals and enchanted to resist wear and tear.
*   **Arcane Warding:** Protective spells and magical barriers used to safeguard personnel and equipment.
*   **Containment Vessels:** Specialized containers used to transport artifacts, particularly those with potentially dangerous magical properties.
*   **Ghost Lanterns:** Lanterns that emit a light that disrupts ethereal beings, helpful when facing ghosts or other spectral entities.
*   **Mobile Base of Operations:** A series of interconnected, heavily modified wagons that serve as a mobile base of operations, providing living quarters, workshops, and storage space.

### Reputation & Notable Contracts

The Ossified Hand enjoys a somewhat ambiguous reputation. Some view them as essential for preserving history and recovering lost treasures, while others consider them grave desecrators and profiteers. 

*   **Recovery of the Sunstone Tablet:** Recovers a tablet detailing the rise and fall of a forgotten sun-worshipping empire.
*   **Extraction of the Serpent's Eye from the Tomb of Xoltan:** Extracts a powerful, cursed artifact from a heavily guarded tomb, encountering numerous undead guardians in the process.
*   **Mapping the Ruined City of Aeridor:** Successfully navigates and maps a previously unexplored ruin, revealing its secrets and potential dangers.

### Recruitment

Recruitment is selective, favoring individuals with specialized skills, a strong sense of discretion, and a willingness to operate in dangerous environments. A trial period is required to assess a candidate's capabilities and loyalty.
