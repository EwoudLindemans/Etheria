# Tallis Thorne Fragment

## Echo of Calculation

This unassuming shard of polished obsidian, roughly the size of a thumb, pulses with a faint, internal hum—a ghost of complex calculations struggling to surface. It is a fragment chipped from a larger, now-destroyed artifact deeply connected to [Tallis Thorne](/generated/hero/character/tallis-thorne.md) and his lifelong pursuit of the *First Algorithm*. Its surface appears smooth, but microscopic examination reveals an intricate lattice of impossibly small, shifting glyphs, constantly reforming into equations and diagrams—a visual [manifestation](/structure/chronological/event/manifestation.md) of pure, compressed information.

The fragment's true significance lies in its ability to store and project brief glimpses into Tallis’s internal thought processes, captured moments before his death. These are not simply memories, but raw data streams reflecting the flow of logic, the architecture of his thought, and the fragmented remnants of his computational models.  It’s akin to catching a single echo from the [Library Between Names](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/tallis-thorne/library-between-names.md) – a fleeting glimpse into the mind of a man who strove to bridge the realms of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and mathematics.

## Properties and Functionality

*   **Resonant Cognition:**  When held by someone attuned to [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) or logic, the fragment resonates with their own cognitive processes. The holder experiences a brief, disorienting flood of fragmented data—equations, diagrams, and seemingly unrelated concepts, all tied to Tallis’s final calculations. The intensity and coherence of these visions depend on the holder's mental acuity and familiarity with complex systems. A skilled mathematician or mage might perceive coherent sequences; a novice will likely experience only chaotic impressions.
*   **Conditional Revelation:** The visions granted by the shard shift in content based on the holder's intentions. Those seeking to understand Tallis's motivations receive glimpses of his philosophies and goals. Those seeking to replicate his work receive glimpses of his methodologies—albeit in a highly fragmented form.
*   **Echoing Calculations:** The fragment occasionally generates short, seemingly random equations and formulas as a side effect. These aren’t always relevant, but skilled arcanists can use them as inspiration for new spells or calculations. However, attempting to forcibly extract these formulas can trigger a feedback loop, causing a brief but potent surge of mental static and disorientation.
*   **Thorne’s Veil Interference:**  Like the [Library Between Names](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/tallis-thorne/library-between-names.md), the fragment is subject to Thorne’s Veil. If forcibly examined with divination or mental probing, the visions it projects become nonsensical and misleading, depicting Tallis as a whimsical inventor perpetually chasing a machine that turns regret into confetti. 

## Historical Significance

The shard is believed to be a remnant of the *Archaic Engine*, a theoretical device conceived by [Tallis Thorne](/generated/hero/character/tallis-thorne.md) intended to encode and manipulate the very fabric of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) through a system of logical structures. While the Engine itself was never completed (destroyed in a catastrophic event linked to his demise), fragments like this offer tantalizing glimpses into his work. Some scholars theorize it holds a crucial key to unlocking the First Algorithm, while others believe it's merely a dead end—a testament to the perils of attempting to reduce magic to a quantifiable equation.

## Warning

Prolonged exposure to the shard's chaotic energy can induce mental fatigue, erratic thought patterns, and a disconcerting sense of being disconnected from reality. It is advised to limit usage and consult with a qualified mental specialist if symptoms persist.
