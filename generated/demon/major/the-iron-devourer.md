# The Iron Devourer

## A Devourer of Industry and Forge-Cities

The Iron Devourer, known in ancient tongues as *Khar'azoth-Moth*, is a major demon lord belonging to the Devourer lineage. Unlike its kin who feast on flesh and organic matter, Khar'azoth-Moth has a uniquely insatiable hunger for metal, machinery, and the very essence of industry. It commands legions of corrupted constructs, animated automatons, and enslaved artificers, relentlessly seeking to dismantle and consume civilized achievements.

## Appearance & Emanations

Khar'azoth-Moth rarely manifests in a fully corporeal form, instead projecting a terrifying spectacle of shifting metal and incandescent heat. When it does, it resembles a colossal, vaguely humanoid figure wrought from blackened iron, constantly reforming and shifting. Gears grind within its body, sparks fly from its joints, and its eyes burn with the molten glow of a forge.

*   **Aura of Rust:** Those within a mile of Khar'azoth-Moth experience accelerated metal corrosion and machinery breakdown. Tools become brittle, weapons crumble, and armor degrades.
*   **Echoes of the Forge:** The air crackles with the sounds of hammering, grinding, and smelting, even in the absence of active forges.  A pervasive scent of sulfur and heated metal fills the environment.
*   **Kinetic Distortion:** The presence of Khar'azoth-Moth creates localized gravity fluctuations, making precise movement difficult and causing instability in structures.

## Domain & Followers

Khar'azoth-Moth's primary domain lies within the *Ashen Wastes* – a perpetually twilight realm of ruined workshops, collapsing factories, and endless slag heaps. The land itself seems drained of life, covered in a fine layer of metallic dust. Scattered across this domain are pockets of devoted followers:

*   **The Scraplords:** Gnomish artificers and engineers driven mad by ambition and corrupted by Khar'azoth-Moth’s influence. They obsessively collect and dismantle metal, seeking to appease the demon.
*   **The Rust Knights:** Fallen dwarven warriors who have traded their honor and smithing skills for unholy power.  They wield rusted weapons and armour, drawing strength from decay.
*   **Automaton Legions:** Mass-produced constructs and enslaved golems, devoid of free will, relentlessly carrying out the demon's bidding.

## Motivations & Goals

Khar'azoth-Moth's overarching goal is to extinguish the flame of innovation and industry across the mortal realms. It believes that metal and machinery are an abomination, a perversion of the natural order. Its long-term goal is to transform entire worlds into barren landscapes of rust and ruin.

It acts as a force of entropy, actively undermining any advancements that could elevate civilizations.

*   **Corrupting Innovation:** The Demon actively seeks to sabotage new technologies, twisting them to serve its destructive purposes.
*   **Undermining Prosperity:**  Khar'azoth-Moth disrupts trade routes, sabotages production facilities, and instigates conflicts over resources, to destabilize prosperous nations.
*   **Harvesting Metal:** The Demon’s forces actively seek out and plunder metal deposits, ruins, and forgotten caches of weaponry, to fuel their own dark forges.

## Notable Relics & Artifacts

*   **The Black Anvil:** A legendary forge of dark metal, capable of creating devastating weaponry and imbuing objects with corrupting energy.
*   **The Gear of Discord:**  A complex mechanism that emits waves of disruptive energy, causing widespread mechanical failure and inciting conflict.
*   **The Shard of Ruin:** A crystalline fragment of solidified entropy, capable of rapidly accelerating decay and corrosion.

## Weaknesses

*   **Purified Earth:** Khar'azoth-Moth’s power wanes significantly in areas of unspoiled nature and vibrant life.  Fertile lands and flourishing forests act as a buffer against its influence.
*   **Order and Precision:**  While it revels in chaos and destruction, Khar’azoth-Moth struggles against forces of meticulous order and unwavering precision. Elven architecture and perfectly calibrated mechanisms are anathema to it.
*   **The Song of Creation:** Ancient melodies that celebrate creation and innovation can disrupt the demon’s connection to the material plane.
