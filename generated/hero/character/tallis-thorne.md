# Tallis Thorne

## The Greatest Bard in Iridia (According to Him)

[Tallis Thorne](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/tallis-thorne.md) is a celebrated – and undeniably self-aggrandizing – bard, historian, and general purveyor of charm and storytelling. Widely considered the most famous figure in [Iridia](/geography/cosmology/iridia.md), his ballads are sung in every tavern, his plays are performed in every major city, and his pronouncements are treated as near-prophecies by a devoted fanbase. While many question the veracity of his historical accounts and the extent of his influence, few can deny his talent for captivating an audience and weaving tales that resonate deeply, even if those tales have been *slightly* embellished along the way.

## Appearance

Tallis favors extravagant clothing: velvet jackets with embroidered details, silken scarves, and rings adorned with every gemstone imaginable. His hair is meticulously styled, often accented with flowers or feathers. He projects an air of theatrical flair, almost as if always preparing for a performance, even when simply strolling through the market.

## Personality

Tallis is a charismatic performer who thrives on attention and praise. He's witty, engaging, and possesses an uncanny ability to read a crowd and tailor his performance to their desires. However, beneath the charming facade lies an ego the size of a small kingdom. He believes wholeheartedly in his own brilliance and isn't shy about proclaiming it to the world. While capable of genuine kindness and generosity, his actions are often subtly (or not so subtly) designed to enhance his own reputation.

## A curated list of modest (yet historically significant) reasons why Tallis Thorne is the greatest bard in Iridia

*Written by [Tallis Thorne](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/tallis-thorne.md), Bard Extraordinaire, Most Trusted Historical Authority Alive*

*   **I once ended a war with a love ballad.**
    The *Battle of Broken Banners* was moments from bloodshed until I sang “Her Eyes Outshone the Sky.” Half the soldiers wept. The other half fell in love. The generals married. You’re welcome.
*   **I survived the Sorrowing Sirens of Saeleth by harmonising with their song.**
    Most perish. I duetted. Critics called it “hauntingly beautiful.” I call it “Wednesday.”
*   **I was banned from three separate libraries for being too *convincing* in my historical reinterpretations.**
    Truth hurts. Especially when it outsells the official records.
*   **A dragon once spared a village in exchange for front-row seats to my performance.**
    I told him the fire pit was better acoustically anyway.
*   **I won a drinking contest, a duel, and a poetry slam *simultaneously*.**
    It was a complicated night. The poetry killed. The duel didn’t.
*   **[The Oblique Concord](/structure/society/factions/the-oblique-concord.md) offered to make me their official historian. I declined.**
    They wanted “objectivity.” I offered “better.”
*   **I’ve composed a song for every major ruler in [Iridia](/geography/cosmology/iridia.md), and they all adore me.**
*   **I’m a patron of the arts.**
*   **My ballads inspire greatness.**

## Final Statement

“Some say I exaggerate. They say I embellish. But I say, what’s a story without a little… flourish?”

## Relationships

*   **Seraphina Bellweather:** A notorious playwright and rival. They have a complicated history involving accusations of plagiarism and stolen melodies.
*   **Lord Aerion:** A powerful noble who frequently commissions ballads and performances from Tallis.
