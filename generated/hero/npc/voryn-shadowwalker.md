**Role:** Tracker, Guide, Information Broker, Potential Ally

**Description:**
Voryn Shadowwalker is a renowned tracker and information broker within the region of Aeridor. Once a prominent member of the Shadow Syndicate, a secretive organization of spies and assassins, Voryn deserted the group years ago, disillusioned by their ruthless methods and obsession with power. Now, they operate independently, lending their skills to those who can afford them – but only if their moral compass aligns with their own.

**Appearance:**
Voryn is of indeterminate age, appearing perpetually in their late 20s or early 30s. Lithe and agile, they move with a quiet grace that belies their considerable strength. Their face is partially obscured by a cowl and loose, dark clothing, designed to blend into shadows.  Their most striking feature are their piercing blue eyes, which seem to glow faintly in low light, and possess an uncanny ability to discern truth from deception.

**Personality:**
Voryn is a stoic and reserved individual, slow to trust and wary of emotional displays. Years spent navigating the treacherous world of espionage have taught them the importance of caution and discretion. Despite their detached demeanor, they possess a strong sense of justice and a deep aversion to needless cruelty. They are fiercely independent and value their freedom above all else. When pushed, they can display surprising loyalty and bravery, though they rarely reveal their true feelings.

**Background:**
Voryn was raised within the Shadow Syndicate from a young age, trained in the arts of stealth, tracking, and assassination. They quickly excelled in their studies and rose through the ranks, becoming one of the Syndicate’s most valuable assets. However, they grew increasingly disturbed by the Syndicate’s willingness to harm innocent people and manipulate events for their own gain. After witnessing a particularly heinous act, Voryn defected, abandoning their former life and embarking on a new path as an independent tracker and information broker.
