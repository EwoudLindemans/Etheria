# The Mawtree Accord

## A Fragile Peace Between Jungle and City

The Mawtree Accord is a treaty, and a legend, detailing the precarious peace brokered between the [Zynkri](/being/species/zynkri.md) Clutchclans of the Tanglewild and the burgeoning [city of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md) decades ago. It’s a document etched onto living bark, sung into the roots, and constantly renewed by the rhythms of the jungle.

### Background: A History of Disruption

Before the Accord, the relationship between the [Zynkri](/being/species/zynkri.md) and Or was defined by cautious trade and frequent, frustrating skirmishes. Or’s expanding wood harvesting and lumber trails steadily encroached on the Tanglewild, disrupting natural pathways, disturbing slumbering beasts, and earning the Zynkri’s ire. Meanwhile, occasional Zynkri raids on Or’s outlying farms, driven by a desire for brighter trade goods and a penchant for elaborate pranks, further strained relations.

The breaking point arrived with the “Great Clearcut” – a poorly-planned Orish attempt to clear a vast swath of the Tanglewild for a new lumber port. The effort triggered a retaliatory campaign of escalating chaos by the [Zynkri](/being/species/zynkri.md), involving collapsing bridges, redirected rivers, and an infamous incident where hundreds of Orish surveyors were covered head-to-toe in shimmering pollen, causing them to speak only in rhyming couplets for three days.

### The Negotiation & the Accord

Recognizing the escalating conflict, a delegation from Or, led by the pragmatic merchant-lord Lysander Corvus, ventured into the Tanglewild. They sought a parley with the combined Clutchclans, a prospect many in Or deemed suicidal. The [Zynkri](/being/species/zynkri.md), sensing genuine fear and a desire for resolution rather than simply more land, agreed to meet under the auspices of the Mawtree.

The negotiations, lasting a full moon cycle, were a bizarre spectacle of barter, trickery, and ritualistic storytelling. The [Zynkri](/being/species/zynkri.md), represented by a council of elders known as the “Whisperweavers,” refused to discuss territory. Instead, they proposed a system of reciprocal obligations tied directly to the health and vitality of the Tanglewild.

The resulting Accord – the Mawtree Accord – established the following:

*   **The Green Toll**: Or’s logging operations were permitted, but only if they paid a “Green Toll” in the form of specialized fungal cultures and water purification techniques in exchange for passage and timber.
*   **The River’s Song**: A system of careful water management to protect the Tanglewild’s rivers and prevent siltation. Or agreed to build specialized weirs and clearings to ensure healthy aquatic ecosystems.
*   **The Whisperweave Pact**: Orish scholars and botanists were granted limited access to the Tanglewild for study, but under strict supervision by the Whisperweavers. Any information gained was to be shared with the [Zynkri](/being/species/zynkri.md).
*   **The Prank Peace**: A formalized agreement acknowledging the [Zynkri](/being/species/zynkri.md)’s right to engage in “controlled mischief” within Or's borders, provided it did not cause serious harm or disrupt trade. This provision, often invoked during festival seasons, has resulted in countless unusual, and occasionally profitable, incidents.

### The Accord Today

The Mawtree Accord remains in effect, albeit constantly renegotiated and reinterpreted. It is a testament to the [Zynkri](/being/species/zynkri.md)’s cunning and the Orish’s begrudging respect for the jungle’s unpredictable nature.  The treaty serves as a crucial lesson in sustainable co-existence, reminding both cultures that disrupting the natural world can have unexpectedly chaotic consequences.

The Accord is overseen by a combined Orish-[Zynkri](/being/species/zynkri.md) council known as the “Rootkeepers,” ensuring that both sides adhere to their obligations. Failure to do so results in escalating penalties, ranging from the deployment of thorny vines across Orish trade routes to forced pollen-delivery services for recalcitrant city officials.
