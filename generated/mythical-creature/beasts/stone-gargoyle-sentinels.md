# Stone Gargoyle Sentinels

## Guardians of the Deep Roads

Stone Gargoyle Sentinels are not naturally occurring creatures. They are magically-animated constructs, meticulously crafted and imbued with a shard of ancient earth [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) by the Dwarrow Clans centuries ago. Initially designed to safeguard the extensive network of underground tunnels and vaults known as the Deep Roads, they’re now primarily encountered guarding abandoned Dwarrow holds and occasionally ancient mines.

## Appearance

These beings resemble traditional gargoyles, but possess a grandeur and permanence exceeding their surface-world counterparts. They’ve been carved from dense granite or slate, ranging from 8 to 12 feet in height. Their forms are typically bestial – often a combination of a lion, eagle, and ram – symbolizing strength, vigilance, and resilience. Key characteristics include:

*   **Immovable Visage:** Their faces are perpetually frozen in an expression of stern watchfulness. Few have identifiable expressions beyond a slight downward curve of the mouth, giving them a look of enduring disapproval.
*   **Crystalline Eyes:** The eyes are made of large, multifaceted crystals that faintly glow with an inner, earthy light. The color varies depending on the stone used for the construction (often shades of grey, brown, or moss green).
*   **Runic Markings:** The bodies are covered in barely visible runic markings. These are part of the magical binding that animates the constructs, and attempting to decipher or alter them can trigger unpredictable (and often dangerous) magical repercussions.
*   **Weathered Stone:** Over centuries of service, they accumulate a thick coating of moss, lichen, and mineral deposits, blending seamlessly into the stonework of their surroundings.

## Abilities & Behavior

Stone Gargoyle Sentinels are relentlessly vigilant and bound by a simple directive: **Protect.** They possess the following abilities:

*   **Stone Skin:** Virtually immune to physical damage. Blunt force trauma and slashing attacks have little effect.
*   **Detect [Magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md):** Possess an innate ability to sense the presence of magical activity within a considerable range.
*   **Animated Stone:** Can launch fragments of their own stone body as projectiles. These fragments are surprisingly accurate and can cause significant blunt force trauma.
*   **Earth Tremor:**  Can induce minor tremors in the surrounding earth, disrupting footing and causing instability.
*   **Silent Guardians:** Move with remarkable silence, making it difficult to detect their approach.

These creatures are not aggressive unless provoked. They are primarily observers and react only when they detect a perceived threat to the area they guard. Their reactions are typically swift and uncompromising.

## Weaknesses

*   **Sonic Vulnerability:**  High-frequency sonic attacks or vibrations can disrupt their magical animation, causing them to temporarily falter or even shatter.
*   **Earth [Magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) Disruption:** Powerful earth magic spells or techniques can overload their connection to the earth, potentially weakening or disabling them.
*   **Runic Interference:** Carefully crafted counter-runes, when placed in proximity, can disrupt the binding [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and render them inert, although this is extremely difficult and requires specialized knowledge.

## Lore & History

The original Dwarrow Clan that created these guardians vanished mysteriously centuries ago. Legends say they retreated deep into the Deep Roads, taking their secrets with them. The Stone Gargoyle Sentinels remain as silent witnesses to their disappearance, eternally fulfilling their duty of protection, even in the absence of their creators.
