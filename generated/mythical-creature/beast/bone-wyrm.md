# Bone Wyrm

## Subtitle: Echoes of Skul'Kruk

Bone Wyrms are monstrous serpentine beings native to the [Skein of Bones](/geography/region/skein-of-bones.md), particularly prevalent in areas heavily influenced by [Skul’Kruk](/being/titan/skul-kruk.md)’s tremors and the activity of the [Ashenfang](/structure/society/clan/ashenfang.md). They are living embodiments of death and decay, born from concentrations of spectral energy and residual bone [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md).

## Origin & Physiology

Unlike traditional dragons, Bone Wyrms aren’t born through egg-laying or traditional mating rituals. Instead, they coalesce from pockets of intense negative energy, often forming where large-[scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) necromantic rituals have occurred or where vast quantities of bone fragments accumulate. These areas, frequently associated with [Ashenfang](/structure/society/clan/ashenfang.md) activity and [Skul'Kruk](/being/titan/skul-kruk.md)'s influence, act as incubators for their unnatural genesis.

*   **Structure:** Their bodies are constructed primarily from articulated bone fragments – ribs, spines, skulls, and limbs – fused together by a spectral substance that resembles solidified shadow.  The arrangement is haphazard and unsettling, giving them a perpetually fragmented appearance. New bones are constantly added to their forms, often taken from recently deceased creatures, and old ones shed during movement or combat.
*   **Size:** Bone Wyrms range in size from smaller 'Dreg Wyrms' barely 10 feet long, to colossal 'Echo Wyrms' that can stretch over 100 feet, dwarfing even the largest [Ashenfang](/structure/society/clan/ashenfang.md) constructs.
*   **Color:** The bones themselves are a sickly, bone-white, often stained with dried blood or covered in a shimmering, gray dust. Their spectral
