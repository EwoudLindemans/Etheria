# Wyvernwood Manor

## A Legacy of Shadow and Whispers

Wyvernwood Manor stands as a brooding monument to a forgotten lineage, nestled deep within the heart of Wyvernwood Forest. Its dark stone walls, shrouded in clinging ivy and perpetually damp mist, seem to absorb the surrounding gloom. The estate, once a symbol of opulent power, now bears the weight of centuries of whispered secrets, unsettling rumors, and a pervasive sense of melancholy.

## History and Lineage

The manor’s origins are shrouded in uncertainty, with records pointing to construction during the early era of the Silverwood Dynasty. However, its most significant history is tied to the House of Corvus, a noble family known for their mastery of arcane arts and their…unconventional methods. 

* **The Corvus Reign (1480 - 1720):** The Corvus family presided over Wyvernwood, cultivating a reputation for both scholarship and ruthlessness. They were renowned for their experiments in alchemy and necromancy, attracting both loyal retainers and wary neighbors. It is said that the very foundation of the manor was laid upon rituals both wondrous and unsettling.  The family’s wealth stemmed from the rare Wyvern’s Tears – shimmering gems found exclusively within the forest – which were used in powerful artifacts.
* **The Fall of House Corvus (1720):** The line abruptly ended with the mysterious disappearance of Lord Valerius Corvus and his entire household during the Harvest Moon Festival. Accounts vary: some claim a sorcerous duel gone horribly wrong, others speak of a pact with dark forces. All agree on one thing: the manor was abandoned overnight, and the Wyvern’s Tears vanished.
* **The Empty Years (1720 - Present):** Generations have attempted to reclaim Wyvernwood, but all have been driven away by an overwhelming sense of dread and strange occurrences. Locals whisper of lingering spirits, unsettling sounds, and a pervasive feeling of being watched.

## Current State

Wyvernwood Manor is now a crumbling ruin, though structurally sound enough to be partially inhabited.  Years of neglect have taken their toll:

* **Exterior:** The stone walls are covered in moss and ivy. Many of the windows are broken or boarded up. The once-grand gardens are overgrown and wild, concealing forgotten statues and decaying fountains.
* **Interior:** Dust and cobwebs cover every surface. The once-ornate furnishings are rotting and decaying. Strange symbols and faded frescoes adorn the walls, hinting at the Corvus family’s arcane practices.
* **Notable Locations:**
    * **The Grand Library:** A vast collection of ancient tomes, many of which are written in forgotten languages. Some are rumored to contain dangerous knowledge.
    * **The Alchemist's Laboratory:** A chaotic space filled with shattered vials, bubbling concoctions, and strange apparatus. The lingering scent of chemicals hangs in the air.
    * **The Family Crypt:** Located beneath the manor, this chilling space houses the tombs of the Corvus lineage. Whispers claim that some of the occupants are not entirely at rest.
    * **The Wyvern's Wing:** A peculiar wing of the manor built in the shape of a massive Wyvern, said to have been used as a sanctuary during times of peril. It is also rumored to contain a secret vault.

## Rumors and Legends

* **The Wyvern's Tears' Return:**  Legend says that the Wyvern’s Tears will return when someone finds the melody of “Corvus’ Lament”, a forgotten song tied to the family’s downfall. When played, the gems will reawaken, revealing the truth behind the Corvus’ disappearance.
* **The Ghost of Valerius Corvus:** Some claim that the spectral form of the last Lord Corvus still haunts the manor, forever searching for the lost Wyvern’s Tears. 
* **The Living Walls:** It is said that the walls themselves are imbued with the memories of those who lived there, sometimes whispering secrets or revealing glimpses of the past.
