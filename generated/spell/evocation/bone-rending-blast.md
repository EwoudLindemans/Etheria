# Bone-Rending Blast

## Evocation: Necromantic

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a sliver of bone, ground to powder)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

### Description

You unleash a focused blast of necromantic energy that tears apart bone and disrupts the cohesion of undead creatures. The blast travels in a line 5 feet wide, originating from your outstretched hand. Each creature in the area must make a Strength saving throw.

On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 necrotic damage and is knocked prone.  Undead creatures automatically fail this saving throw and take double damage.

On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and is not knocked prone. 

### Scaling 

**2nd Level:** Damage increases to 6d8. **3rd Level:** Damage increases to 8d8. **4th Level:** Damage increases to 10d8.

### Origin

This spell is a favored technique among Graveflame Artificers and those who follow [Skul'Kruk](/being/titan/skul-kruk.md). It is often taught as a first step in bone manipulation, demonstrating the destructive potential within the skeletal framework.

### Lore

The power of this spell stems from disrupting the natural bonds that hold bone together - a principle fundamental to Graveflame Artistry. Experienced practitioners claim the spell can be refined to specifically target specific types of bone, making it surprisingly effective against armored opponents.
