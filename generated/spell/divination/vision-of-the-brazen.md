# Vision of the Brazen

## A Divination Spell of Chaos and Glimpses

**School:** Divination
**Level:** 3
**Casting Time:** 1 minute
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S, M (a single drop of [Brazen Brew](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/consumable/brazen-brew.md), which is consumed)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

**Description:**

Upon consuming the single drop of the volatile [Brazen Brew](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/consumable/brazen-brew.md), you enter a brief, erratic state of divinatory perception. The Brew grants fleeting, fragmented visions of potential futures, all filtered through the lens of chaotic inspiration and unpredictable outcomes. These visions are not clear prophecies but rather fleeting glimpses – flashes of scenes, snatches of conversations, and symbolic imagery – that require interpretation and careful consideration.

**Effect:**

While concentrating on this spell, you can gain glimpses of potential outcomes related to a specific question or goal. You must clearly define your question when casting the spell. Each round, roll a d20.  The results are interpreted as follows:

*   **1-5 (Turbulent Chaos):**  You experience a jarring, unsettling vision. The vision is vague, symbolic, and potentially misleading. The DM will provide a brief, chaotic image that may or may not be relevant to your query.  Attempting to further analyze this vision immediately results in a temporary -2 to Intelligence checks for 1 minute.
*   **6-10 (Fleeting Insight):** You see a brief, potentially relevant scene from a possible future. The DM describes a concise (2-3 sentence) snapshot of a situation tied to your question. The accuracy of this future is uncertain.
*   **11-15 (Echoes of Possibility):** You hear fragmented snippets of conversation related to your question. These snippets are unclear and may be distorted, but they hint at possible outcomes.  These snippets provide vague advice regarding your query.
*   **16-20 (Moment of Clarity - Rare):** You gain a clearer, more detailed vision, allowing you to glimpse a potential future outcome. The DM provides a detailed (4-6 sentence) description of the scene, offering more specific information. 

**Interpretation:**

The visions granted by *Vision of the Brazen* are inherently unreliable and influenced by the Brew’s chaotic nature. Proper interpretation is crucial. Consult with wise individuals, consider the context of the visions, and be wary of drawing definitive conclusions based solely on these fleeting glimpses.  The visions often require symbolic understanding.

**Side Effects:**

*   **Temporary Fumbling:** After the spell ends, you suffer a -2 penalty on Dexterity checks for 1 hour, due to lingering incoordination.
*   **Propensity for Song:**  A sudden urge to burst into song may overcome you. (DM’s discretion)
