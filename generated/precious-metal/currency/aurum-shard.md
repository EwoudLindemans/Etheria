# Aurum Shard

## A Fragment of Starlight, a Currency of Iridia

The Aurum Shard is the primary currency of [Iridia](/geography/cosmology/iridia.md), a small, polished fragment of solidified starlight. Unlike the common coinage of many lands, Aurum Shards are not minted or forged. They are *found*, primarily within the Whisperwind Caves beneath the Silverpeak Mountains, though rare deposits have been discovered in other locations touched by celestial events.

## Origin and Properties

Legend claims Aurum Shards are remnants of the Starfall – a cataclysmic event millennia ago when fragments of a shattered celestial being rained down upon [Iridia](/geography/cosmology/iridia.md). These fragments solidified into the distinctive, shimmering material known as Aurum. Each shard possesses a faint, internal luminescence, pulsating gently with a soft, gold light. The color and intensity of the luminescence varies slightly from shard to shard, considered by some to be a measure of its value or inherent 'star-power'.

Aurum is extraordinarily durable, resisting corrosion and physical damage. It’s also remarkably light, a key factor in its practicality as a currency for trade across [Iridia](/geography/cosmology/iridia.md). However, it possesses a unique and unsettling property: prolonged contact with Aurum can induce vivid dreams and heightened emotional states. This effect is more pronounced in those with latent magical abilities, leading to some societal debates about the long-term psychological impact of widespread Aurum use. 

## Value and Denominations

Aurum Shards are valued in a decimal system, although practical usage often involves rounding to the nearest convenient fraction.

*   **Dust of Aurum:** The smallest denomination, essentially microscopic shavings of Aurum. Used for tips and very small purchases. Worth a fraction of a 'Singular'.
*   **Singular:** A single, small shard, roughly the size of a thumbnail. Considered the basic unit of currency.
*   **Duo:** Two Singulars bound together with enchanted silver wire. Common for larger transactions.
*   **Triad:** Three Singulars bound together – a sign of prosperity and used primarily in ceremonial payments.
*   **Quintet:** Five Singulars, denoting a significant sum. Often traded for goods and services of high value.
*   **Decade:** Ten Singulars, a substantial amount. Used in major land purchases, contracts, or significant investments.

## Relationship to Other Iridian Elements

The presence of Aurum is inextricably linked to the [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) inherent in [Iridia](/geography/cosmology/iridia.md). 

*   **[Gloriana](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/tallis-thorne/gloriana.md)’s [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md):**  Aurum Shards held within the vicinity of Gloriana, the magical lyre of [Tallis Thorne](/generated/hero/character/tallis-thorne.md), exhibit a slight intensification of their internal luminescence. Whether this signifies a genuine magical interaction or merely a quirk of perception is subject to scholarly debate.
*   **Whisperwind Caves:** The Whisperwind Caves are heavily guarded, not solely to prevent theft, but to regulate the flow of Aurum into the economy. Excessive extraction is believed to disrupt the natural [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) flows of the region, potentially causing localized weather anomalies and weakening the barrier against the Shadow Weave.
*   **[Miss Terry](/being/character/miss-terry.md)’s Scrying:** It’s rumored that Miss Terry possesses the ability to scry the value of Aurum Shards and predict shifts in their market, making her a sought-after advisor amongst merchants and nobles.

## Societal Impact

The unique nature of Aurum has shaped [Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) society in profound ways. Its scarcity fuels the economy, but its magical properties create a unique cultural tension. The pursuit of Aurum is a driving force for exploration and conflict, yet it’s also a source of deep-seated anxieties about the stability of [Iridia](/geography/cosmology/iridia.md)’s ethereal balance. There's a constant debate regarding the safety of Aurum and its potential long-term effects, prompting cautious regulation of its use, particularly among children. The Aurum Shard, a fragment of the stars, is more than just currency – it’s a symbol of Iridia’s interwoven fate with the cosmos.
