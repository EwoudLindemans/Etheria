# The Stone Haven

## A Refuge in the Grey Peaks

The Stone Haven is a sturdy inn nestled at the base of the Grey Peaks, a frequent stopping point for travellers, miners, and mercenaries alike. Carved partially into the mountainside, its stone walls offer a welcome respite from the biting winds and unpredictable weather common to the region.

### Location & Ambiance

Located in the small mining town of **Grimstone**, the Stone Haven sits along the main thoroughfare, easily visible from both ends of town.  The exterior is built with dark grey stone, reinforced with thick timbers and featuring a steeply pitched roof designed to shed heavy snowfall. A large, welcoming hearth glows constantly in the front window, casting a warm light onto the bustling street.

Inside, the inn is surprisingly cosy. Rough-hewn wooden beams crisscross the ceiling, and a roaring fireplace dominates the common room.  The air smells of woodsmoke, roasted meat, and spiced ale.  The decor is functional rather than opulent, with sturdy tables and chairs, simple tapestries depicting scenes of mining and hunting, and shelves lined with books and maps.

### Proprietor & Staff

The inn is run by **Bronwyn Stonefist**, a dwarf with a stern but fair demeanour.  She inherited the establishment from her father and has maintained its reputation for quality food, strong drink, and reliable security. Bronwyn is a skilled negotiator and a formidable presence, capable of handling even the most unruly patrons.

*   **Garrick:** A human bartender known for his encyclopedic knowledge of local gossip and his exceptional skill in mixing drinks.  He's a quiet observer and can often be relied upon for useful information (for a price).
*   **Elara:** A half-elf waitress who is quick on her feet and always has a kind word for everyone. She's particularly adept at handling difficult customers and smoothing over any misunderstandings.
*   **Torvin:** A hulking, silent dwarf who serves as the inn's bouncer and occasional handyman. He doesn’t say much, but his presence alone is usually enough to deter troublemakers.

### Accommodation

The Stone Haven offers a variety of rooms to suit different budgets and preferences:

*   **Common Room:** A large, open area with several tables and chairs. Ideal for travellers on a tight budget or those who prefer a more social atmosphere.
*   **Private Rooms:** Several small, sparsely furnished rooms with a bed, a chair, and a small washbasin.  Prices vary depending on size and amenities.
*   **Suites:** Two larger rooms with a bed, a seating area, and a private bathroom. These are reserved for wealthier patrons or those who prefer more privacy.

### Food & Drink

Bronwyn Stonefist is renowned for her hearty and delicious meals.  The menu features traditional dwarven fare, with a focus on meat, potatoes, and hearty stews:
