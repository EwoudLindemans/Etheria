# The Stone Song Inn

## A Haven of Echoes and Warmth

The Stone Song Inn clings to the slopes of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains like a stubborn lichen, a testament to resilience and quiet comfort. More than just a place to rest weary bones, it’s a repository of memories, a gathering place for travelers, and a keeper of the mountain’s secrets. The inn's name comes from the peculiar hum that permeates the stonework, a low [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) that some say is the mountain itself singing.

## Location

Located on the Old Serpent's Pass, a notoriously winding route that connects the lowlands to the mountain kingdoms, The Stone Song is strategically positioned to provide respite for those brave enough to traverse the treacherous path.  It’s approximately three days travel from the [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md) and roughly a day's journey from the foothills bordering the Silverwood Forest. A small, well-maintained carriage road leads to the inn from the main path, allowing for easier access.

## Atmosphere

The interior is surprisingly warm and inviting, a stark contrast to the rugged exterior.  The common room is dominated by a massive stone hearth, perpetually crackling with a cheery fire. Walls are lined with rough-hewn wood paneling and adorned with faded tapestries depicting local folklore. The air smells of roasting meats, brewing ales, and a faint hint of woodsmoke.  Despite its rustic appearance, the inn maintains a surprising level of cleanliness and order, reflecting the careful stewardship of its owner.

## Proprietor

**Elder Borin Stonebeard** is a weathered dwarf with a gentle smile and eyes that have witnessed centuries of mountain life. He is known for his quiet wisdom, his legendary ability to find lost travelers, and his surprisingly deft hand at carving intricate wooden figurines. Borin inherited the inn from his grandmother, a fabled herbalist known for her healing potions and cryptic prophecies.
