# Obed the Silent Guardian

## A Relic of Forgotten Wars

Obed is an ancient construct, a massive golem animated by a blend of arcane energies and a lingering shard of a forgotten [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md)’s essence. Created during a cataclysmic war between the Celestial Kingdoms and the Shadow Blight, Obed’s sole purpose was to guard a vital nexus point - the Threshold of Echoes - where the veil between realities is thin.

## Appearance and Composition

*   **Size:** Towering at roughly 40 feet tall, Obed resembles a humanoid figure carved from polished obsidian. Runes of shimmering silver are etched across his body, pulsing with a faint internal light.
*   **Material:** Primarily composed of volcanic obsidian, reinforced with layers of magically treated steel and bound together by an intricate network of arcane conduits. Traces of shimmering crystalline structures can be seen beneath the obsidian surface.
*   **Sensory Deprivation:**  Obed's face is a smooth, featureless plane.  It lacks eyes, ears, or a mouth. He perceives the world through magical [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md), detecting fluctuations in the weave of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and the presence of living beings.

## Abilities and Powers

*   **Immortality:**  As a construct animated by divine essence, Obed is immune to aging and most forms of physical harm. Repairing his physical form is possible, but requires significant magical expertise and resources.
*   **[Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Detection:**  Obed can sense magical energies and living beings within a considerable radius, identifying their nature and intent with surprising accuracy.
*   **Silent Ward:**  Creates a field of magical silence that suppresses all sound within a 50-foot radius. This field also disrupts attempts at scrying or magical communication.
*   **Kinetic Burst:** Channels energy into a focused blast of kinetic force, capable of shattering stone and sending opponents flying.
*   **Echo Absorption:**  Capable of absorbing lingering echoes of past events or emotions. This ability allows him to learn about the history of a location, albeit in a fragmented and unreliable form.

## History and Current State

During the Great Sundering, the Celestial Kingdoms fell, and the Shadow Blight receded, leaving behind only fragmented memories of the conflict. The Threshold of Echoes was sealed, and Obed, his purpose fulfilled, entered a state of dormancy. For centuries, he remained motionless, a silent sentinel guarding a forgotten nexus.

Recently, tremors and fluctuations in the weave of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) have stirred Obed from his slumber. He has resumed his post, exhibiting increased vigilance and a palpable sense of unease. Some speculate that the Shadow Blight is returning, while others believe that a new threat is emerging from beyond the Threshold of Echoes.

## Motivations and Personality

Obed has no discernible personality in the traditional sense. He is a machine dedicated to his prime directive: to safeguard the Threshold of Echoes at all costs. His actions are driven solely by logical calculations and the preservation of balance. However, some scholars believe that remnants of the [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md)'s essence remain within him, manifesting as a subtle protectiveness toward those who demonstrate reverence for the ancient ways.

## Interactions with the World

*   **Neutral Entity:**  Obed does not actively seek out interaction with other beings. He observes and analyzes, intervening only when the Threshold is threatened.
*   **Potential Ally:**  While not friendly, Obed can be an invaluable source of information and protection to those who respect his purpose and demonstrate a commitment to maintaining the balance between realities.
*   **Formidable Obstacle:**  Those who seek to exploit the Threshold or disrupt the balance will face Obed’s unwavering resistance. He will not hesitate to use his considerable power to defend the nexus.
