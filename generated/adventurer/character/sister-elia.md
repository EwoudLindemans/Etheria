# Sister Elia

## The Weaver of Veils

Sister Elia is a human cleric of [[[deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md)|Anya]], the goddess of memory and stories. She's a gentle soul, outwardly calm and collected, but carries a burden of forgotten histories and a keen understanding of the fading fabric of existence. She's drawn to places touched by the Veil, locations where the boundaries between realities thin and memories bleed through.

## Appearance

*   **Age:** Appears to be in her late 40s, though her true age is a closely guarded secret (potentially much older). 
*   **Height:** 5’7"
*   **Build:** Slender, almost frail, but carries herself with quiet dignity.
*   **Hair:** Silver streaked with remnants of dark brown, always meticulously braided and adorned with small woven charms.
*   **Eyes:** Deep blue, often appearing distant as if gazing at something beyond the immediate present.

## Background

Elia hails from the isolated village of Whisperwind, a place renowned for its keepers of ancient lore and its unsettling proximity to the Veil. She joined the Order of the Veiled Memory at a young age, drawn to its dedication to preserving the stories and experiences of those lost to time and the encroaching entropy of the world.

She witnessed a tragedy during her early years as a keeper – the complete erasure of an entire village, swallowed by a rupture in the Veil. Only Elia, shielded by a forgotten ritual, survived, carrying the burden of their lost memories and the chilling knowledge of the Veil's power to obliterate existence.

This event fueled her determination to understand and safeguard the remaining fragments of history before they vanish forever. She now travels the land, seeking out places where the Veil is active and attempting to recover lost memories, often using her cleric abilities to soothe troubled spirits and mend fractured timelines.

*   **Knowledgeable and resourceful:** She has a vast understanding of history, folklore, and the workings of the Veil, making her a valuable ally in situations involving forgotten lore or temporal anomalies.
