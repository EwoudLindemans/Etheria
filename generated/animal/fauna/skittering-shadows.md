# Skittering Shadows
## A Subterranean Arachnid

The Skittering Shadows are peculiar arachnids unique to the deep tunnels beneath the [city of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md). Unlike surface spiders, they’re pale, almost translucent, with legs that end in delicate, almost skeletal hooks. They're named for their unsettlingly quiet movement - they practically *flow* through the darkness, barely disturbing the dust, making them incredibly difficult to detect until it’s too late. They’re roughly the size of a housecat, though their elongated bodies and thin legs give the impression of something larger and more unsettling.

## Biology & Behavior

Skittering Shadows are adapted entirely to a life of darkness and silence. Their large, milky-white eyes are sensitive to the faintest of infrared signatures, allowing them to navigate and hunt in complete blackness. They possess an extraordinarily acute sense of vibration, able to detect the slightest tremor in the stone, allowing them to anticipate the movements of prey or avoid danger.  Their bodies are incredibly flexible, allowing them to squeeze through impossibly small cracks and crevices, and their thin, chitinous exoskeletons are surprisingly resilient to blunt force.

These arachnids are primarily carnivorous, feeding on insects, cave-dwelling rodents, and occasionally, unwary travellers. They’re ambush predators, lying motionless in the shadows for hours, even days, waiting for an opportunity to strike. Their venom is fast-acting, causing paralysis and disorientation before delivering a fatal bite.  Perhaps most disturbingly, they appear to have a strange fascination with echoes and resonating frequencies. It is said that they will gather around areas where sounds reverberate, seemingly absorbing the vibrations and using them to navigate or even communicate, a theory still heavily debated by Or’s scholars.

## Relationship to the City of Or

The presence of Skittering Shadows is a constant source of unease for the citizens of Or, especially those who dwell in the lower levels of the city or work in the extensive tunnel networks. While they rarely venture to the surface, the tunnels beneath the city are teeming with them.  There are whispers amongst the city's Tunnel Wardens that the creatures are somehow attuned to [the Fargash Gambit](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/the-fargash-gambit.md), sensing its subtle fluctuations and drawing closer during periods of heightened activity. Some scholars theorize that the creature's interest in vibrations is a result of this connection.

Furthermore, the creatures are a crucial part of the Or’s subterranean ecosystem, controlling rodent populations and serving as a food source for larger, subterranean predators. However, their unsettling nature and potential danger necessitate careful management and constant vigilance by the city’s authorities. Rumors abound of secret hunts, organized by the Wardens, to control their numbers and prevent them from encroaching on inhabited areas.

## Notable Traits

*   **Silent Movement:** Their almost undetectable movement makes them incredibly difficult to spot.
*   **Infrared Vision:** They can “see” in complete darkness using heat signatures.
*   **Vibration Sense:**  Extremely sensitive to vibrations in the stone.
*   **Echo Affinity:** Appears to be attracted to resonating frequencies, potentially using them for navigation and communication.
*   **Pale Exoskeleton:** Their translucent bodies blend seamlessly with the shadows.

## Warnings

*   Avoid venturing alone into the lower levels of Or, especially at night.
*   Be mindful of unusual vibrations or echoing sounds - they could indicate the presence of a Skittering Shadow.
*   Do not disturb or provoke these creatures. Their venom is highly dangerous.
