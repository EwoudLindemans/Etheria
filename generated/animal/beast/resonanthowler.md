# Resonanthowler

## A Whisper of Echoes and Shadow

The Resonanthowler is a creature of profound quietude and unsettling mimicry, native to the fragmented forests and ruined settlements ringing the [Shifting Mire](/geography/cosmology/landscape/shifting-mire). Unlike beasts of pure physicality, the Resonanthowler exists as a semi-corporeal echo—a creature born from the lingering [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) of forgotten events and the echoes of shattered [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md).

Appearance-wise, the Resonanthowler resembles a large feline—roughly the size of a lynx—with a lean, almost skeletal frame. Its fur is not fur at all, but a constantly shifting tapestry of faint, spectral colours—shades of grey, violet, and faded blues that seem to absorb rather than reflect light. Most unnerving is its face, or lack thereof. Instead of eyes, nose, and mouth, the Resonanthowler possesses a smooth, blank surface, like polished stone. As it moves, faint, fleeting images—memories imprinted on its very being—flash across its blank face: a laughing child, a burning building, a whispered promise—each a spectral impression of forgotten lives and moments.

## The Mimic's Gift

The Resonanthowler's most remarkable ability lies in its mimicry, but unlike parrots or mockingbirds, it doesn't simply replicate sounds. Instead, it *absorbs* and *replays* resonant memories—fragments of emotion, spoken words, and ambient sounds from places steeped in trauma, magical upheaval, or profound loss. A Resonanthowler near the ruins of Old [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md), for instance, might whisper the lamentations of the fallen city, or replay the clash of arms from a centuries-old battle, interweaving these fragments with mournful howls and echoing sighs. The accuracy of these replays are startling—so much so that seasoned historians have been known to seek out Resonanthowlers near sites of historical significance, hoping to glean lost information.

However, listening to a Resonanthowler is not without peril. The echoes it projects aren’s merely recordings; they carry a residue of the original emotions. Prolonged exposure to a Resonanthowler can leave listeners emotionally drained, plagued by intrusive thoughts, and even susceptible to experiencing fleeting glimpses of the events it replicates. Those with existing trauma are particularly vulnerable to the creature’s influence.

## Resonance and Behaviour

The Resonanthowler’s existence is inextricably linked to [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md). It thrives in areas saturated with residual magical energy—places where powerful spells were cast, ancient rituals were performed, or significant tragedies occurred. It uses this energy to sustain itself, slowly absorbing and repurposing the memories embedded within it. Interestingly, the Resonanthowler actively seeks out and avoids areas where the land has been magically cleansed or restored. It seems that a place free of lingering resonance is anathema to its very existence.

Their behaviour is largely solitary and elusive. They move with a disconcerting silence, phasing through undergrowth as if it weren't there. While not actively aggressive, Resonanthowlers are fiercely protective of their territories, which often encompass the most resonant and emotionally charged locations in the surrounding area. Intruders are met not with direct attack, but with a barrage of unsettling echoes—a carefully orchestrated symphony of dread and despair designed to drive them away.

## Lore & Superstitions

Local folklore paints the Resonanthowler as a harbinger of ill fortune—a creature born from the tears of forgotten spirits. Some believe they are guardians of lost souls, bound to these places by regret and lingering sorrow. Others claim they are malevolent spirits, delighting in tormenting the living with reminders of past tragedies. In regions where they are common, children are warned to avoid areas where a Resonanthowler might lurk, lest they be plagued by unsettling dreams and intrusive memories. Regardless of the specific beliefs, one thing is clear: the Resonanthowler is a creature to be approached with caution and respect—a living testament to the enduring power of the past.
