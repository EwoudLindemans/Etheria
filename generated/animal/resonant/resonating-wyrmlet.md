# ⚛️ Resonating Wyrmlet

## Small Echoes of Harmony and Discord

The Resonating Wyrmlet is not born; it *emerges*. A rare phenomenon of the Fracture Realm bleeding into the material plane, these serpentine creatures are living embodiments of unintentional [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) – tiny, mobile echoes of larger, more potent harmonic disruptions.

They are most commonly observed near sites imbued with strong Fracture energy, particularly those linked to the worship of [Vexyrra](/being/deity/vexyrra.md), or near areas where significant magical events have occurred leaving behind lingering echoes. They are not native to the standard cycles of life and death; instead, they coalesce from residual [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) – a ripple in reality shaped by a song misplayed, a spell cast with a fractured intention, or even a heartfelt prayer sung just slightly off-key.

## Appearance & Biology

Resonating Wyrmlets are small, typically reaching only 3 to 5 feet in length. Their bodies are slender and scaled, exhibiting a shifting, opalescent sheen. Colors vary wildly depending on the type of [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) that birthed them—a wyrmlet formed from a corrupted healing spell might display sickly greens and browns, while one born from a burst of elemental fire could exhibit shimmering reds and oranges.  A defining characteristic is the crystalline ridges that run along their bodies, constantly vibrating with subtle energy.  These ridges aren’t solely aesthetic; they function as resonators, amplifying and projecting the energies they absorb.

Most notable are their voices. Rather than a hiss or growl, Resonating Wyrmlets communicate through fractured, melodic tones – snippets of remembered songs, disjointed phrases, and echoing whispers. These sounds are often unnervingly familiar, pulling on the listener's memories and emotions.

## Resonance and Behavior

Resonating Wyrmlets are drawn to sources of [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) like moths to a flame. They feed not on physical matter, but on ambient magical energy, drawing power from echoes of past events and the emotional residue left behind. They have a particular affinity for areas where [Vexyrra](/being/deity/vexyrra.md) is worshipped, often congregating near sites of intentional harmonic dissonance. 

Their behavior is often unpredictable, influenced by the type of [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) they are drawing upon. Some may display playful curiosity, mimicking sounds and movements, while others can become agitated if exposed to jarring or conflicting energies.  Prolonged exposure to a single Resonating Wyrmlet can subtly influence the emotions and memories of nearby creatures, creating feelings of deja vu, unexplained sadness, or a sudden surge of nostalgia.  [Stonfin Dustbinder](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/runehollow-hall/stonfin-dustbinder.md) has theorized that careful observation of Wyrmlet vocalizations can offer clues to the nature of past magical occurrences.

## Interaction and Dangers

While generally not aggressive, Resonating Wyrmlets can become dangerous if provoked or if they are drawing upon particularly volatile [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md).  When distressed, they release a concussive wave of distorted sound, capable of disorienting and stunning nearby creatures.  Prolonged exposure to this
