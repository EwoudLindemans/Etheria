# Dolores Stoneheart

## Master Scholar of Geomancy and Stone Singing

Dolores Stoneheart is a renowned Master Scholar at the Academy, specializing in Geomancy and the rarer, more esoteric practice of Stone Singing. Her reputation precedes her – whispered about in hushed tones amongst students and faculty alike – a blend of profound intellect and an enigmatic, almost unsettling, connection to the earth itself.

## Background and Expertise

Dolores's origins are shrouded in mystery. Rumor has it she was raised in the isolated mountain holds of the **Stonekin**, a reclusive dwarven clan known for their unparalleled understanding of geological forces and their ability to commune with the very essence of stone. She emerged onto the wider scholarly world seemingly out of nowhere, presenting groundbreaking theses on the piezoelectric properties of subterranean crystals and the resonant frequencies of tectonic plates.  

Her primary expertise lies in:

*   **Geomancy:** Dolores's work has revolutionized the Academy's understanding of geomancy, moving beyond simple divinatory practices to a more scientific and predictive approach. She developed a complex system of crystalline matrices that allow for the accurate mapping of underground ley lines and the prediction of seismic activity.
*   **Stone Singing:**  This ancient practice, rarely studied, allows a skilled individual to perceive and even influence the memories and energies embedded within stones.  Dolores is considered the foremost expert on Stone Singing alive, capable of extracting narratives from the oldest rocks and channeling the earth's power through carefully orchestrated vocalizations.
*   **Crystalline [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md):**  A novel field she pioneered, focusing on the interaction between [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and crystalline structures. Her research has opened up new possibilities for magical amplification, storage, and manipulation.

## Teaching Style & Philosophy

Dolores’s lectures are notoriously challenging, known for their density, complexity, and lack of sentimentality. She demands absolute precision and intellectual rigor, tolerating no superficial understanding. Despite her stern demeanor, those who persevere find a mentor of unparalleled depth and insight. She believes that true understanding comes not through rote memorization but through challenging assumptions and probing the fundamental truths of the universe.

“The Earth remembers everything,” she is often quoted as saying. “It is our duty to listen.”

## Notable Achievements

*   **The Stone Memory Theorem:** A groundbreaking theoretical framework that describes the capacity of stone to retain and transmit information across vast timescales.
*   **The Seismosong Protocol:** A protocol developed with the Academy's geomancers to mitigate earthquake damage through resonant frequency modulation.
*   **Recovered Lost Annals of the Stonekin:** Utilizing Stone Singing, Dolores recovered centuries-old records detailing the Stonekin’s ancestral history, preserving invaluable cultural heritage.

## Physical Appearance

Dolores is a tall, imposing figure, with a severe countenance framed by thick, grey braids interwoven with small, polished stones. Her eyes are a striking shade of grey, often described as “like looking into granite.” She typically wears simple, functional robes of grey and brown, adorned with subtly carved patterns of geological formations. She always carries a smooth, river-worn stone, which she occasionally runs her thumb over during moments of contemplation.

## Current Projects

*   **The Grand Stone Archive:** Dolores is spearheading a project to establish a comprehensive archive of stone samples from across the known world, meticulously cataloging their geological history and magical properties.
*   **The Harmonic [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Initiative:** A research project aimed at developing a system for harnessing the Earth’s natural resonant frequencies to power the Academy.
