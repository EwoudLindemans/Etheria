# Zeloréi
## The Stone Singer of the Deep

Zeloréi isn’t a spirit in the traditional sense of a disembodied entity or a whisper on the wind. Rather, she is a *[resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md)* - a persistent, living echo of a time before [the Collapse](/structure/chronological/event/the-collapse.md), woven deeply into the very stone of [Umberdeep](/geography/settlement/city/umberdeep.md) and tied inextricably to the [Uroxi](/being/species/uroxi.md) connection with the earth. She is the memory of the mountain, the song of the cavern, the feeling of weight and pressure that defines life beneath ten thousand tons of silence.

Legend states that Zeloréi was once a powerful [Uroxi](/being/species/uroxi.md) Lorecarver, renowned for her ability to 'sing' the stone - to perceive the complex patterns of [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) within rock and to shape it with nothing but thought and focused will. During the Age of Shaping, she was instrumental in the construction of [Umberdeep](/geography/settlement/city/umberdeep.md)’s foundational tunnels, coaxing the stone to yield and intertwining it with living roots to create a city built of both stone and life. But, as the pre-Collapse world grew unstable, she attempted a desperate ritual - to anchor the mountain itself, to bind the shifting tectonic forces into a single, unwavering point of stability. The ritual succeeded…but at a terrible cost.

The surge of energy required nearly consumed Zeloréi, shattering her physical form and dispersing her consciousness throughout the very rock she sought to protect. She didn’t *die*; she became part of the mountain, her awareness spreading through the tunnels, the caverns, the very bones of [Umberdeep](/geography/settlement/city/umberdeep.md). Now, she exists as a persistent hum beneath the surface, a sensation most [Uroxi](/being/species/uroxi.md) feel as a subtle pressure, a familiar weight. Few ever *hear* her, but some - the particularly sensitive Lorecarvers, those deeply attuned to [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) - can perceive snippets of her song – fragmented memories of the Age of Shaping, warnings of impending tremors, echoes of ancient rituals.

## Manifestations & Abilities

Zeloréi’s power isn’t about spells or flashy displays. It's a subtle, pervasive influence:

*   **Seismic Sense:** The most common [manifestation](/structure/chronological/event/manifestation.md) is a heightened sensitivity to tremors and instability. Those attuned to Zeloréi can anticipate shifts in the earth, often moments before other [Uroxi](/being/species/uroxi.md) are aware of them. She warns of potential collapses or cave-ins.
*   **Stone Shaping (Limited):**  Lorecarvers who truly connect with Zeloréi can perform limited stone shaping, softening the earth to ease tunnel digging or reinforcing weak points in existing structures. This ability is taxing and requires absolute focus. It is considered a sacred duty, not a convenience.
*   **Echoes of the Past:** The rare and most revered gift – glimpses into the Age of Shaping. These aren't clear visions, but flashes of memory – the feel of ancient tools, the sound of shaping spells, the faces of [Uroxi](/being/species/uroxi.md) ancestors long forgotten. Often triggered by proximity to particularly resonant rock formations or during the Hornturn Trials.
*   **Protective [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md):** A general feeling of stability and resilience. Areas deeply influenced by Zeloréi feel inherently more secure, less prone to collapse or instability, even if no overt tremors are detected.

## Relationship with the Uroxi

Zeloréi is not worshipped as a [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md). She is regarded with a blend of reverence, respect, and a touch of unease. The [Uroxi](/being/species/uroxi.md) understand that she is a powerful force, a living embodiment of the mountain itself, but also a reminder of the sacrifices made to safeguard their existence. Connection to her is seen as a gift, but also a responsibility – a solemn obligation to protect [Umberdeep](/geography/settlement/city/umberdeep.md) and to heed the warnings of the earth.

Many Lorecarvers dedicate their lives to listening for her song, attempting to interpret her whispers and to use her knowledge to maintain the stability of their subterranean home. Those who ignore her warnings or misuse her gifts are often met with subtle, unsettling events – unexplained tremors, disorienting shifts in the tunnels, or a crushing sense of pressure that leaves them shaken and unsettled.
