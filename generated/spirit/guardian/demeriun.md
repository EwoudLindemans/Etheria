# Demeriún: The Obsidian Warden

## A Spirit of Stone and Shadow

Demeriún is an ancient spirit of guardianship, bound to specific geological formations – typically volcanic rock, obsidian deposits, or deep cave systems. It embodies the steadfastness of stone and the protective shroud of shadow, acting as an unwavering sentinel against corruption and intrusion.

### Appearance

Demeriún manifests as a humanoid figure composed of obsidian and volcanic rock. Cracks and fissures in its form glow with a dull red light, hinting at the fiery energy contained within. It stands tall and imposing, its movements slow and deliberate, radiating an aura of immense age and power. Its eyes are hollow sockets filled with swirling shadows, reflecting a wisdom forged in the earth's depths.

### Origin and Lore

Legends say Demeriún was born from the first volcanic eruption, coalescing from the cooling lava and absorbing the protective energy of the mountains. Initially, it was merely a force of nature, instinctively defending its territory from erosion and external threats. Over millennia, a rudimentary consciousness developed, shaped by interactions with ancient civilizations who sought shelter within its domain. These civilizations revered Demeriún as a guardian against subterranean horrors and invaders from the surface world. With the decline of those civilizations, Demeriún’s role shifted, and it became increasingly solitary, a silent watchman against the encroaching darkness.

### Abilities & Powers

*   **Geokinesis:** Demeriún can manipulate earth and stone with incredible precision. It can create fissures, raise barriers, shape rock into weapons, and trigger localized tremors. This ability is amplified within its bonded geological formations. 
*   **Shadow Cloak:**  A constant shroud of shadow surrounds Demeriún, making it difficult to detect and providing a form of natural camouflage.  It can also extend this cloak to obscure areas or individuals within its immediate vicinity.
*   **Petrification Gaze:** Demeriún's gaze can slowly turn living flesh to stone.  The process is gradual, starting with numbness and stiffness, and culminating in full petrification.  A successful Wisdom saving throw (DC 17) can temporarily resist the effects.
*   **Earthen Resilience:** Demeriún is exceptionally resistant to physical damage.  Its stony form grants it damage resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. It also has advantage on saving throws against being petrified.
*   **Echoes of the Past:**  Demeriún retains fragmented memories of the civilizations that once worshipped it. It can sometimes provide cryptic insights into the past, though these revelations are often shrouded in symbolism and require careful interpretation.

### Weaknesses

*   **Elemental Vulnerability:** While resilient to many forms of physical damage, Demeriún is particularly vulnerable to water and ice [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md). Sustained exposure to these elements can weaken its form and disrupt its connection to the earth.
*   **Bound by Location:** Demeriún’s power is intrinsically linked to the geological formation it guards. If separated from its bonded location, its abilities are significantly diminished, and it becomes vulnerable.
*   **Emotional Stagnation:**  Centuries of solitude have left Demeriún emotionally stagnant. It struggles to understand or respond to complex emotions, often reacting with indifference or cryptic pronouncements.

### Interactions

*   **Neutral Guardian:** Demeriún typically remains aloof from the affairs of the mortal realm, concerned only with maintaining its duty as a guardian.  However, it may intervene if a significant threat arises that endangers its bonded territory or the delicate balance of the underground ecosystem.
*   **Cautions:** Approaching Demeriún without respect for its duty and territory is ill-advised. It may respond with hostility, believing that interlopers are attempting to violate its sacred charge.
