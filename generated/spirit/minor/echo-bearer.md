# Echo-Bearer

## Minor Spirit - Conduit of Faith

**Category:** Minor Spirit, Conduit Spirit
**Alignment:** Variable (reflects the [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md) they represent)
**Rarity:** Common (in areas of established faith)

Echo-Bearers are not spirits in the traditional sense. They are individuals, often unaware of their nature, who act as conduits for a [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md)'s [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md), extending the deity's influence beyond the confines of their home [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md). They are, in essence, living antennae for divine belief.

## Origin & Nature

An individual becomes an Echo-Bearer through a confluence of factors:

*   **Strong Faith:** A deep and unwavering belief in a particular [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md).
*   **Resonant Personality:** Certain personality traits, often linked to the [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md)'s domain (e.g., courage for a war god, wisdom for a knowledge deity), amplify their [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md).
*   **[Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) Proximity:** While not always required, being within or near a Scale dedicated to their [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md) increases the likelihood of becoming an Echo-Bearer.

They do *not* wield divine power. Instead, their presence subtly reinforces the [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md)'s influence, making prayers more effective, bolstering faith in the surrounding area, and creating subtle coincidences that nudge events in the deity's favor.

## Abilities & Manifestations

*   **Faith Amplifier:**  Their mere presence strengthens prayers and rituals dedicated to their [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md).
*   **[Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Cascade:**  When experiencing strong emotions aligned with their [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md)'s domain (joy, sorrow, anger, etc.), they generate a localized Resonance Cascade – a brief surge of divine energy detectable by those attuned to faith.
*   **Intuitive Guidance:** Many Echo-Bearers experience subtle intuitive feelings or dreams that align with their [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md)'s will. These are often interpreted as divine guidance.
*   **Subtle Influence:**  Echo-Bearers can unconsciously influence the behavior of those around them, subtly nudging them towards actions that benefit their [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md) (e.g., inspiring generosity for a prosperity deity, encouraging bravery for a war deity).

## Weaknesses

*   **Loss of Faith:**  If an Echo-Bearer loses their faith, their [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) fades, and they cease to be a conduit.
*   **Counter-[Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md):** Exposure to strong, opposing faith can disrupt their resonance, weakening their connection to their [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md).
*   **Exploitation:** Those skilled in manipulating [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) can potentially exploit Echo-Bearers, twisting their connection to the [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md) to serve nefarious purposes.
*   **Vulnerability to [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) Shifts:** A major Scale shift, particularly one abandoning the [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md) they represent, can sever their [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) and leave them disoriented and vulnerable.

## Role in the World

*   **Unintentional Servants:** Most Echo-Bearers are entirely unaware of their role in the world, living ordinary lives while unknowingly serving as conduits of faith.
*   **Sources of Local Faith:** They act as subtle anchors for local faith, ensuring the [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md)’s influence remains strong within a particular region.
*   **Potential for Discovery:** Skilled faith-workers or [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) mages may be able to identify and potentially harness the power of Echo-Bearers – though doing so carries significant risks.
