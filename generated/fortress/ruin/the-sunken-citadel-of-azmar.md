# The Sunken Citadel of Azmar

## A Forgotten Bastion of the Deep

The Sunken Citadel of Azmar is a sprawling ruin located within the Abyssal Trench, a region perpetually shrouded in darkness and immense pressure. Once a proud fortress of the Azmari, a now-vanished civilization known for their mastery of underwater construction and aquatic [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), the Citadel now lies half-submerged, slowly crumbling under the relentless forces of the deep.

## History

According to fragmented records recovered from scattered Azmari artifacts, the Citadel served as a key strategic point in the Azmari's control of the Whisper Sea. Its location allowed them to monitor and intercept seafaring vessels of other cultures, and its defenses were considered nearly impenetrable.

Azmar's fall is a tragic tale. It is believed they were betrayed from within, with a powerful mage named Xal’tor using forbidden [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) to summon a colossal aquatic horror, the Kraken of R’lyeth, which devastated the city. The Azmari, caught completely off guard, were overwhelmed, and the Citadel sank beneath the waves.

## Current State

The Citadel is now a perilous and haunting place, infested with mutated aquatic creatures, remnants of the Azmari’s failed magical experiments, and the lingering influence of Xal’tor’s dark [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md). The structure itself is severely damaged, with many chambers collapsed or flooded. However, portions of the Citadel remain remarkably intact, particularly those reinforced with Azmari’s unique crystalline alloys.

**Notable Features:**

*   **The Grand Archive:** A vast library of Azmari knowledge, many scrolls and tablets are miraculously preserved within magically-sealed chambers. However, some are guarded by animated constructs and illusions.
*   **The Crystal Nexus:** A central chamber where the Azmari harnessed underwater geothermal energy. It is said that the Nexus still holds a residual magical energy and may be reactivated.
*   **The Xal’tor's Sanctum:** The former residence of the traitorous mage Xal'tor, this chamber is said to contain powerful artifacts and potentially dangerous magical traps.
*   **The Bioluminescent Gardens:** A series of caverns filled with glowing fungi and strange aquatic flora, providing a rare source of light in the abyssal depths.

## Inhabitants

*   **Abyssal Ghouls:** Animated remains of Azmari soldiers, guarding specific areas of the Citadel.
*   **Deepwater Jellyfish:** Massive, bio-luminescent jellyfish that patrol the outer reaches of the Citadel.
*   **Mutated Crustaceans:** Horrific creatures warped by Xal’tor's [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and the deep-sea environment.
*   **Xal'tor's Echo:** A spectral remnant of Xal'tor, said to haunt the Sanctum, occasionally revealing cryptic clues about the Citadel’s secrets.
*   **Rumored: The Kraken's Spawn:** Some whispers suggest that offspring of the Kraken of R’lyeth dwell within the deepest chambers of the Citadel, waiting for an opportunity to rise.
