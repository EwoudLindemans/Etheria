# Resonance Blight

## A Disease of Magical Echoes

[Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Blight is a debilitating and increasingly common disease primarily affecting individuals with a strong connection to [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) – particularly those who are spellcasters, artisans who imbue their creations with magic, or individuals living in areas saturated with magical residue. It’s believed to be a corruption stemming from the unchecked flow and echo of magic leaking from destabilized Heart Nodes and similar magical foci – particularly those linked to the Heart itself.

## Symptoms & Progression

The initial symptoms of [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Blight are subtle and often mistaken for fatigue or minor magical instability. They typically include:

*   **Magical Static:** A persistent tingling sensation in the limbs, accompanied by faint, erratic magical sparks and discharges. This is often described as a feeling of 'static' interfering with spellcasting or magical crafting.
*   **Phantom Echoes:**  Faint auditory and visual hallucinations of past magical events – whispers of ancient spells, brief flashes of past enchantments, or echoes of powerful magical constructs. These echoes become more frequent and vivid over time.
*   **Mana Sensitivity:** An exaggerated sensitivity to ambient mana. Large concentrations of magical energy cause discomfort, headaches, and erratic magical fluctuations.

As the disease progresses, the symptoms escalate dramatically:

*   **Echo Amplification:** The phantom echoes intensify, blurring the line between memory and reality. Victims struggle to distinguish between their own past and the echoes of other magical events.
*   **Magical Instability:** Spellcasting becomes unpredictable and dangerous. Spells misfire, backfire, or manifest in distorted and unexpected ways. The caster loses fine control over their [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md).
*   **Resonant Distortion:** The victim’s body begins to resonate with the echoes of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md). Their physical form may shimmer and distort, occasionally manifesting fleeting images of other magical beings or locations. Prolonged exposure to strong magic fields can cause temporary or permanent physical transformations.
*   **Mana Leeching:** The Blight begins to leech [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) from the victim, leaving them physically weakened and magically depleted.

The final stage of [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Blight is marked by complete magical dissolution. The victim's body dissolves into a swirl of raw, uncontrolled magical energy, leaving behind only a residue of distorted echoes.

## Causes & Transmission

The primary cause of [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Blight is prolonged exposure to unstable or corrupted magical energy—often stemming from:

*   **Heart Node Leaks:**  As mentioned previously, the most common source is leaks from damaged or improperly maintained Heart Nodes.
*   **Echo Zones:** Areas where intense magical events have left lingering [resonances](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) in the environment. These zones amplify the effects of Resonance Blight.
*   **Corrupted Artifacts:**  Artifacts imbued with corrupted [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) can act as focal points for the disease.

Transmission is primarily magical. Direct physical contact is rarely the vector; instead, the disease spreads through:

*   **Magical Proximity:** Remaining in close proximity to an infected individual or a source of unstable [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) increases the risk of infection.
*   **Resonant Objects:** Handling objects that have absorbed corrupted magical energy can transmit the disease.
*   **Echo [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md):** While rare, some victims can inadvertently spread the Blight through their own magical aura or the echoes they emit.

## Treatment & Prevention

There is currently no known cure for [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Blight. Treatment focuses on:

*   **Mana Nullification:** Attempting to dampen or suppress the victim's connection to [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) can slow the progression of the disease, but this is risky and often ineffective.
*   **Echo Dampeners:** Specialized devices that attempt to filter out the corrupted echoes, but their effectiveness is limited.
*   **Sympathetic [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md):** A risky technique where a skilled mage attempts to 'absorb' the corrupted echoes from the victim, potentially transferring the disease to themselves (very dangerous and requires immense skill).

Prevention primarily involves:

*   **Regular Heart Node Maintenance:** Ensuring Heart Nodes are properly maintained and shielded to prevent leaks.
*   **Avoidance of Echo Zones:** Steer clear of areas known to be saturated with unstable [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md).
*   **[Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Wardings:** Protective wards that filter out corrupted magical energy.
*   **Early Detection:** Constant monitoring for early symptoms is crucial for any individual living close to a Heart Node or within areas of high magical activity.
