# Election Festival

## A Celebration of Civic Duty and Hearty Merriment in Stonehollow

The [Election Festival](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/election-festival.md) is an annual celebration held in Stonehollow, the primary district of the city of Oakhaven. It serves as both a formal announcement of candidates for civic offices and a grand public festival, incorporating traditional customs, spirited competitions, and abundant feasting.

## Origins and Purpose

Legend dictates the festival originated centuries ago, as a means to quell disputes during the city's early governance. Before the formal election process was established, settling candidate disagreements often devolved into factional brawls and simmering resentments. The festival was envisioned as a means to channel that energy into a structured, entertaining competition, culminating in a declaration of leadership.

While the structured election process has evolved significantly, the core spirit of the Festival remains: a celebration of civic engagement and a reaffirmation of community values.

## Timeline and Key Events

The festival typically spans three days, beginning with the Grand Announcement and culminating in the Feast of the New Dawn.

*   **Day 1: The Grand Announcement:** Representatives from each district formally present their chosen candidates for available civic offices (Councilor, Guild Representative, etc.). Candidates deliver brief speeches outlining their platforms and visions for the city. The announcement is broadcast via city-wide proclamations and amplified speakers.
*   **Day 2: The Trials of Stonehollow:** A series of competitions and challenges designed to test the qualities needed for civic leadership. These include:
    *   **The Wisdom Gambit:** A public debate between candidates, judged by a panel of esteemed scholars and guild representatives. (Often a point of much-needed chaos).
