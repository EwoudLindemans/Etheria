# Lumina Fungi

## Bio-luminescent Network of the Gloomwood

Lumina fungi are a unique and vital component of the Gloomwood ecosystem. Unlike typical fungi, they possess a complex bio-luminescent network that permeates the forest floor, creating an ethereal glow and facilitating communication across vast distances. They are not parasitic, but rather engage in a symbiotic relationship with the trees and other organisms of the forest.

## Appearance & Structure

*   **Form:** Lumina fungi typically manifest as interconnected mycelial mats and small, bulbous fruiting bodies. The fruiting bodies range in size from a pinhead to a grapefruit and emit a soft, pulsating light. Colors vary depending on the species, ranging from cool blues and greens to warm oranges and violets.
*   **Mycelial Network:** An extensive network of glowing mycelia spreads beneath the forest floor. This network acts as a central nervous system for the entire fungal colony, allowing rapid communication and nutrient transfer.
*   **Glowing Sap:** The sap of Lumina fungi is intensely luminous and contains compounds that react to environmental changes, altering the intensity and color of the glow.

## Ecological Role

*   **Communication:** Lumina fungi utilize pulsed light patterns to communicate with each other and with the trees of the Gloomwood. These patterns can indicate danger, nutrient availability, or even coordinate growth.
*   **Nutrient Cycling:** Like other fungi, Lumina fungi play a crucial role in breaking down organic matter and releasing nutrients back into the soil. Their extensive mycelial network allows for rapid absorption and distribution of nutrients across the forest floor.
*   **Forest Beacon:** The constant glow of Lumina fungi provides a source of light in the otherwise dark Gloomwood, attracting various nocturnal creatures. This also guides wandering travelers, though relying on this glow is not without risk.
*   **Symbiotic Bonds:** Lumina fungi have a special connection to the Whisperwood Trees. They seem to exchange information and nutrients, creating a feedback loop that enhances both organism's resilience.

## Subspecies (Examples)

*   **Azure Bloom:** Large, azure-colored fruiting bodies that pulsate with a slow, calming rhythm. Their light is believed to have mild restorative properties.
*   **Crimson Spire:** Tall, slender fruiting bodies that emit a rapid, flickering red light. Signals distress or impending danger.
*   **Veridian Net:** These form broad, web-like mats across the forest floor, emitting a consistent, soft green glow. Often found near Whisperwood Trees.

## Exploitation & Risks

*   **Luminar Essence:** The glowing sap is highly sought after for its properties in alchemical and magical practices. However, harvesting the sap damages the fungus and disrupts the forest's communication network.
*   **Disruption of Networks:** Excessive harvesting or artificial interference with the mycelial network can create 'dead zones' within the Gloomwood, negatively impacting the ecosystem.
*   **Mimicry & Deception:** Certain predatory creatures have learned to mimic the light patterns of Lumina fungi to lure prey closer, creating a dangerous illusion of safety.
