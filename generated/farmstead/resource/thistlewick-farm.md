# Thistlewick Farm

## A Haven of Quiet Resilience

Thistlewick Farm sits nestled in the shadow of the Whisperwind Peaks, a small but vital holding in the valley. Unlike the sprawling estates of the landed gentry, Thistlewick is a family farm, passed down through generations. It's known for its hardy crops, particularly its resilience against the unpredictable weather patterns that sweep through the region.

## History & Ownership

Originally established by Elara and Silas Thorne nearly two centuries ago, Thistlewick was built on a patch of stubbornly fertile soil. Elara, a pragmatic herbalist, and Silas, a skilled stonemason, sought a life of quiet independence. Their descendants have maintained that spirit, tending the land with a blend of traditional methods and a willingness to adapt.

Currently, the farm is managed by **Brenna Thorne**, a woman in her late thirties known for her keen eye and unwavering work ethic.  She’s fiercely protective of the farm’s legacy and is determined to keep it thriving, even as times change. Her father, **Old Man Thorne**, still offers advice, though his hands are now more suited for whittling than tilling.

## Specialization & Produce

Thistlewick isn’t known for producing luxury goods. It's a farm built on necessity and resilience. Their primary crops include:

*   **Root Vegetables:** Carrots, turnips, parsnips – hardy staples that store well through the harsh winters. These are a major trade good, supplying the nearby town of Oakhaven.
*   **Grain:** A hardy variety of wheat, known for its strength and ability to withstand drought.
*   **Medicinal Herbs:** Elara Thorne’s legacy lives on. Brenna cultivates a small patch of herbs used for tinctures and poultices – a secret recipe passed down through the family.
*   **Thistlebloom Honey:** A unique product, only produced by bees that forage on the thistle fields surrounding the farm. It is known for its distinctive, slightly bitter flavor and purported healing properties.

## Notable Features

*   **The Stone Well:** An ancient well, built by Silas Thorne himself, is the farm's primary water source. Local legend claims it connects to an underground spring.
*   **The Beehives:** A cluster of stone beehives, built into the hillside, house Brenna's bees. The apiary is a source of both pride and constant vigilance – bear attacks are a recurring threat.
*   **The Repair Shed:** Silas's original stonemason's shed, still standing, houses a collection of tools and half-finished projects. It’s a repository of the farm's history and a testament to the enduring craftsmanship of its founders.

## Current Challenges

*   **Shifting Weather Patterns:**  Unpredictable storms and prolonged droughts are increasingly common, threatening crop yields.
*   **Bear Activity:**  Bears are a constant threat to the beehives and livestock.
*   **Labor Shortage:**  Finding reliable farmhands has become increasingly difficult.
