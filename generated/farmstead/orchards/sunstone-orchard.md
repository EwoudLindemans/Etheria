# Sunstone Orchard

## A Bastion of Light and Sweetness

The Sunstone Orchard clings to the slopes of the Whisperwind Mesa, defying the prevailing winds and rocky terrain.

Legend has it that the orchard was founded by a wandering oracle named Lyra, who sought a place imbued with potent solar energy to cultivate fruits of unparalleled sweetness.

Her methods were esoteric, incorporating rituals and chants alongside traditional farming practices, a combination that has been passed down through generations of caretakers.  The orchard was taken over by the Greenthumb Guild, who continue to honor Lyra’s original teachings alongside implementing more standardized farming techniques.
