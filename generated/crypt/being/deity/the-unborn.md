# The Unborn

## A Shifting Domain of Potential

[The Unborn](/being/deity/the-unborn.md) is a unique and enigmatic [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md) within the Tread, distinguished by its constantly shifting domain and an unsettling ambiguity surrounding its nature. Unlike other deities whose territories adhere to relatively consistent geographic and thematic boundaries, the Unborn's domain – known simply as the **Shifting Expanse** – is a realm of perpetual change and unrealized potential.

## Nature and Domain

Rumors and fragmented accounts suggest [the Unborn](/being/deity/the-unborn.md) is the nascent consciousness of [Iridia](/geography/cosmology/iridia.md) itself, the spark of creation before fully coalescing into the pantheon of established deities. Others whisper that it's a fractured echo of a forgotten god, shattered into countless possibilities, never to become whole.  Whatever its origin, the Unborn embodies the concept of 'what could be.'

**The Shifting Expanse** reflects this concept.  It isn't a stable domain like Dawnreach or Askarath's Blight. Instead:

*   **Geography is Fluid:** Landscapes twist and morph seemingly at random. One moment it might be a crystalline desert, the next a rainforest teeming with unknown flora and fauna. Features can appear and disappear without warning.
*   **Laws of Physics are Optional:** Gravity, time, and even the fundamental elements sometimes behave differently within the Expanse. Some areas might exhibit reversed polarity, while others might exist outside of temporal flow.
*   **Potential Manifests:** The Expanse is said to be saturated with unrealized possibilities. Objects, beings, and entire realities flicker into existence, only to vanish moments later. Powerful echoes of other deities’ domains can momentarily bleed into the Expanse, offering glimpses of alternate worlds.

## Connection to Scales and Adjacency

Unlike most deities, [the Unborn](/being/deity/the-unborn.md)’s connection to [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) is fragmented and indirect. It doesn't anchor its domain to a single Scale but rather to a network of *potential Scales* – places in the mortal world where great possibility or profound change is brewing. This gives the Unborn the ability to 'reach out' across vast distances and influence events in unexpected ways.

**Domain Adjacency is… Peculiar:** Due to its fluid nature, [the Unborn](/being/deity/the-unborn.md)'s domain doesn’t truly *border* other domains in the conventional sense. It is, instead, said to exist *between* them, a liminal space where the boundaries of reality are blurred. However, glimpses of specific domains can manifest within the Shifting Expanse, creating temporary adjacencies.

*   **Echoes of Vel Hollow:** [The Unborn](/being/deity/the-unborn.md)'s domain often showcases fleeting reflections of the secrets held within Vel Hollow.
*   **Potential for Sootgrove Chaos:** Whispers suggest the Shifting Expanse is a potent source for chaos, often mirroring the ever-shifting rules of Sootgrove.
*   **A Fleeting Glimpse of Dawnreach:** Moments of profound clarity or potential realization can open fleeting portals to the radiant certainty of Dawnreach.

## Followers and Cults

[The Unborn](/being/deity/the-unborn.md)’s worship is unconventional, attracting individuals drawn to change, uncertainty, and the potential for new beginnings. There isn't a centralized cult but rather a loose network of small, disparate groups:

*   **The Dreamweavers:** Seek to glimpse the future within the Shifting Expanse, interpreting the fleeting possibilities as divine guidance.
*   **The Architects of Change:** Believe the Shifting Expanse holds the key to reshaping reality, using its unpredictable energies to enact their own agendas.
*   **The Acolytes of Potential:** Embrace the inherent uncertainty of existence, seeking to unlock their own hidden potential and defy the limitations of the mortal world.

## Fears and Vulnerabilities

[The Unborn](/being/deity/the-unborn.md)’s greatest fear is stagnation – the cessation of potential, the hardening of possibility into fixed reality.  Therefore, the Unborn is vulnerable to:

*   **The Erasure of [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md):**  The complete destruction of all potential Scales would effectively erase [the Unborn](/being/deity/the-unborn.md)’s connection to the mortal world, weakening its domain.
*   **The [Manifestation](/structure/chronological/event/manifestation.md) of Fixed Reality:**  The creation of an unchanging, immutable world would be a fatal blow, extinguishing the essence of [the Unborn](/being/deity/the-unborn.md).
*   **The Consolidation of Other Deities:**  If another [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md) were to fully manifest and solidify its domain, drawing too much potential into itself, it could stifle [the Unborn](/being/deity/the-unborn.md)’s existence.

## Rumors & Lore

*   Some scholars believe the [Ragged Goons](/generated/political-faction/faction/ragged-goons.md) are attempting to exploit [the Unborn](/being/deity/the-unborn.md)'s domain as a gateway to introduce foreign deities into the Tread.
*   It is said that rare artifacts, known as 'Possibility Shards,' can be found within the Shifting Expanse, each containing a fragment of unrealized potential.
*   Powerful mages have attempted to enter the Shifting Expanse to unlock their own hidden potential, but few have ever returned unchanged – or at all.
