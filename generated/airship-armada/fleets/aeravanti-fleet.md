# Aeravanti Fleet

## History and Purpose

The Aeravanti Fleet is the flagship armada of the Skyward Dominion, renowned for its speed, precision, and devastating aerial strikes. Founded during the Dominion's early expansionist era, the fleet was originally conceived as a rapid deployment force, capable of swiftly securing vital resources and quelling rebellions across the vast aerial expanse.  Over centuries, it has evolved into the Dominion’s elite military force, spearheading major campaigns and guarding the Dominion’s most valuable trade routes.

## Composition and Ship Types

The Aeravanti Fleet is comprised of a diverse range of airships, each specialized for a specific role. Core to the fleet are the following ship types:

*   **Apex-Class Sky Lancers:** These are the primary combat vessels, heavily armed with ballistae, arcannon batteries, and reinforced hulls. They are the backbone of the fleet's offensive power.
*   **Swiftwing Reconnaissance Vessels:** Nimble and fast, these ships are crucial for scouting enemy positions and gathering intelligence. They boast advanced optical telescopes and communication arrays.
*   **Thunderclap Siege Platforms:** Massive, heavily armored platforms equipped with devastating siege weaponry, including sonic disruptors and volatile alchemical mortars. They are deployed to break through fortified positions and level enemy installations.
*   **Aetherium Transports:** These specialized ships are responsible for transporting troops, equipment, and vital supplies. Their hulls are shielded with Aetherium plating, allowing them to traverse even the most turbulent air currents.
