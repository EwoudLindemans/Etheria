# Sky Serpent Class Dreadnought

## Apex Predator of the Azure Expanse

The Sky Serpent is the flagship of the Aerilon Freeholds’ military, a behemoth of engineering and arcane power designed to dominate the skies and crush enemy formations. It’s a mobile fortress, a symbol of Aerilon's technological prowess and unwavering resolve. No airship inspires more dread in the hearts of their enemies than the sight of a Sky Serpent breaking through the clouds.

## Overview

The Sky Serpent class is the largest and most heavily armed airship currently fielded by the Aerilon Freeholds. Construction is extremely expensive, requiring rare materials and the combined effort of multiple Skyforge Foundries. As such, only a limited number exist, each serving as the centerpiece of a squadron or fleet. They’re designed to provide heavy firepower, command and control capabilities, and serve as a mobile defensive platform.

## Design & Construction

*   **Hull:** The hull is constructed from reinforced Aerilon Steel, interwoven with intricate runic matrices that provide enhanced structural integrity and resistance to both physical and magical damage. The exterior plating is treated with a specialized refractive coating, making it difficult to target with conventional weaponry.
*   **Propulsion:** Four massive, magically-charged Aetherium Engines provide immense thrust, allowing the Sky Serpent to achieve remarkable speed and maneuverability despite its size. These engines are constantly maintained and refined, and their failure is a catastrophic event.
*   **Aetherium Core:** The heart of the Sky Serpent is its Aetherium Core, a tightly controlled and contained source of raw Aetherium energy. This core powers the ship's engines, weaponry, and various support systems. A breach in the Core is invariably fatal.
*   **Crew Complement:** 250 – 300 (Officers, Engineers, Gunners, Navigators, Support Staff)

## Armament

The Sky Serpent is equipped with a devastating array of weaponry designed to overwhelm and destroy any opposition:

*   **Primary – Arcane Cannon Batteries (12):** These massive cannons unleash bolts of concentrated magical energy, capable of shattering fortifications and vaporizing smaller vessels. The projectiles are magically guided, making them difficult to dodge.
*   **Secondary – Plasma Torpedo Launchers (6):** These launchers fire plasma-based torpedoes, which detonate on impact, unleashing devastating explosive and thermal effects. They are particularly effective against armored targets.
*   **Tertiary – Rapid-Fire Ballistae (18):** These ballistae are automated and deliver rapid-fire volleys of piercing projectiles, capable of shredding smaller airships and crippling larger ones.
*   **Defensive – Rune-Charged Shields:** The Sky Serpent is protected by powerful Rune-Charged Shields, which deflect incoming projectiles and absorb magical attacks. The shields can be reinforced with emergency power, but this significantly reduces engine performance.
*   **Point Defense – Automated Drone Swarm:** A swarm of smaller, remotely controlled drones provides close-range defense against missiles, torpedoes, and smaller aerial threats.

## Notable Features

*   **Command Bridge:** Situated at the uppermost point of the ship, the Command Bridge provides unparalleled visibility and allows the Captain to coordinate fleet operations.
*   **Skyforge Workshops:** Specialized workshops allow for on-board repairs and modifications to weaponry and equipment.
*   **Aetherium Refineries:** Small-[scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) refineries allow for the processing and storage of Aetherium, extending the ship’lls operational range.
*   **Detention Cells:** Secure detention cells are used to contain prisoners of war or captured saboteurs.
*   **Observation Decks:** Multiple observation decks provide panoramic views of the skies and allow the crew to scout for potential threats.

## Variants

*   **Sky Serpent - Command:** Focuses on command and control capabilities, with enhanced communication arrays and larger crew quarters for command staff.
*   **Sky Serpent - Siege:** Equipped with specialized siege weaponry, such as bombardment mortars and demolition charges, designed for attacking ground fortifications.
*   **Sky Serpent - Assault:** Optimized for close-range combat, with increased armor plating and enhanced defensive weaponry.
