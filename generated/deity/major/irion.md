# Irion, the Veiled Architect

## Domain: Veils, Memory, Forging, Lost Things

[Irion](/being/deity/irion.md) is a enigmatic [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md) venerated primarily in Or, though whispers of his influence reach across the Harthrûn. Unlike the more overtly active gods, Irion's presence is subtle, woven into the fabric of existence like the Veils themselves. He is not a god of direct intervention but a patron of what is lost – memories, objects, and potentially, even forgotten paths. His worship intertwines heavily with the culture surrounding the [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md) and the refinement of Scalewrought Ores, making him a uniquely dwarven deity, though not exclusively so.

## Appearance and Manifestations

[Irion](/being/deity/irion.md) rarely manifests in a traditional form. Instead, he is perceived through echoes and subtle shifts in reality. Those particularly attuned, like certain Heartsmiths and Veiled [Iridians](/being/species/iridian.md), claim to glimpse fragmented images: a shapeless silhouette wreathed in shimmering veils, the glint of forged steel, and fleeting visions of forgotten places. His ‘voice’ is not a booming proclamation but a whisper within the mind, a feeling of [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) rather than instruction.

Some claim [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)’s presence is strongest within the [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md) itself, particularly when Veilsteel is being crafted. During the forging process, it is said the air grows thick with echoes of memories, and skilled Heartsmiths can momentarily 'feel' Irion's guidance—a sensation described as the precise angle of a hammer strike or the optimal cooling time.

## Lore and Mythology

[Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)’s origins are shrouded in mystery. Ancient texts, painstakingly recovered from the Veiled Ruins, speak of him as a 'first architect,' the being who initially shaped the Veils before the Great Sundering.  It is believed he foresaw the eventual degradation and fragmentation of reality, and began weaving a network of memory anchors – the Veil Threads – to preserve fragments of what would be lost.

The most widely accepted myth depicts [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md) as a benevolent, if distant, figure.  He is credited with the creation of the first Veil Threads, anchoring lost memories to prevent the complete erosion of reality.  When the Deepening Fracture (Arc 130) exposed the Heart’s influence, it was seen as a sign of Irion’s intentional re-emergence, seeking to reconnect with the mortal world and perhaps, to guide those who could harness his power.

Some scholars theorize that [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md) is not a singular entity but a [manifestation](/structure/chronological/event/manifestation.md) of the Veils themselves – a collective consciousness formed from the echoes of countless lost things.  This theory aligns with the lore surrounding the [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md), which uses Memory Shards to bind and refine Irion's essence.

## Worship and Practices

[Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)'s worship differs significantly from the more boisterous traditions dedicated to gods like Korthak. It is a contemplative, introspective practice centered around remembrance and preservation.  

*   **The Vigil of the Deep:** The most important religious festival, observed by dwarves across Or. Families forge Vigil Tokens – small discs of Veilsteel inscribed with the names and likenesses of lost miners—believing these tokens serve as anchors for the departed's memories. 
*   **Memory Gardens:** Quiet places maintained in city districts where small objects representing lost loved ones are placed.  Regular tending of these gardens is seen as a form of prayer.
*   **[Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md) Reverence:** Heartsmiths perform silent rituals before forging Veilsteel, beseeching [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)'s guidance and ensuring that the crafting process honors the lost memories they are attempting to preserve.
*   **The Order of the Veil:**  A monastic order dedicated to studying the Veils and seeking to understand [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)'s intentions.  They are often consulted by the Council of Elders regarding matters of planar integrity.

## Relationship with Other Deities

[Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)’s relationship with other deities remains unclear. He is largely neutral in the ongoing conflicts between the dominant Harthrûn gods. While Korthak is the patron of strength and war, Irion represents quiet endurance and remembrance. Some speculate that Irion maintains a cautious alliance with Theronas, god of knowledge, sharing a common goal of safeguarding lost information. Conversely, whispers claim a strained relationship with Myra, goddess of the Earth, whose followers often view the [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md)'s exploitation of Scalewrought Ores as sacrilegious.

## Risks and Future

The recent reliance on the [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md) and its draw on the Heart poses a potential risk to [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)’s stability. As more Scaleforged Ores are refined, the Veils become more permeable, leading to unpredictable planar shifts and surges of forgotten memories. Some scholars fear that an unchecked exploitation of Irion's essence could unravel the very fabric of reality, blurring the boundaries between the mortal world and the Veiled Ruins—a prospect that both excites and terrifies the followers of the Veiled Architect.
