# Graith Encounter: The Undertide's Claim

## A Subaquatic Threat from the Lost Wake

Encountering [Graith](/being/species/graith.md) is rarely a matter of choice. They don’t seek conflict, but rather, recover what the sea has claimed. However, the Graith's methods are unsettling, their purpose shrouded in rituals lost to time. These brine-souled seafarers are not simple monsters; they are custodians of a realm beyond mortal comprehension, bound to their ancestral trench—the Lost Wake—and dedicated to collecting the echoes of drowned souls. Their encounters often revolve around retrieving lost artifacts, exploring sunken vessels, or, more disturbingly, confronting the Graith's attempts to claim recent losses to the sea.

## Encounter Setup

**Location:** A flooded ruin, a shipwreck resting on the seabed, or a particularly turbulent area of the ocean floor exhibiting strange currents.  Consider locations near Folded Current, Xaratius or Morakai for a stronger thematic connection to the [Graith](/being/species/graith.md) origin.

**Trigger:** The party unwittingly stumbles upon a [Graith](/being/species/graith.md) ritual, disturbs a sunken vessel they are investigating, or the spirits of recently deceased individuals call out for help, attracting the Graith’s attention.

**Number of [Graith](/being/species/graith.md):** 3-6, depending on the party's level.  Consider including a Graith Drowner-Priest (see *Monsters* -> *Graith* -> *Graith* for details) as a leader or key figure.

**Environment:** The environment should be oppressive. Low visibility due to murky water, powerful currents, and strange, echoing sounds.  Consider incorporating bioluminescent flora and fauna, or areas exhibiting reverse-flow currents based on their home in the Lost Wake.

## Encounter Phases

**Phase 1: The Observation**

The encounter begins with the party noticing unsettling signs. Whispers carried on the current, strange bioluminescent patterns shifting on the seabed, or the faint sounds of chanting. The [Graith](/being/species/graith.md) are observing the party, assessing their intentions. They might not immediately attack, but rather, attempt to communicate through gestures, or through manipulated currents and sounds—mimicking voices or projecting visions of those lost to the sea. This phase tests the party's perception and encourages roleplaying. 

**Phase 2: The Claim**

If the party resists the [Graith](/being/species/graith.md)'s initial attempts at communication, or if they've disturbed a claimed site, the encounter escalates. The Graith reveal themselves, surrounding the party.  The Drowner-Priest, if present, leads the ritualistic claim. They're not interested in a straight fight; their goal is to recover what the sea has claimed. This might involve:

*   **Retrieving an Artifact:** The [Graith](/being/species/graith.md) believe a specific artifact holds a fragment of a lost soul. They will relentlessly pursue its recovery.
*   **Rescuing a Soul:** A recently deceased individual lingers near the party. The [Graith](/being/species/graith.md) attempt to draw the soul towards them, using mesmerizing chants and manipulating the surrounding currents.
*   **Claiming a Vessel:** The party’s own ship, or a partially salvaged wreck, is targeted. The [Graith](/being/species/graith.md) attempt to drag the vessel deeper, reclaiming it for the seabed.

During this phase, the [Graith](/being/species/graith.md) utilize the environment to their advantage. They manipulate currents to disorient the party, create temporary barriers of silt and debris, and employ *Crushing Undertow* (from their Legendary Actions) to pull individuals towards the depths.

**Phase 3: The Ritual’s Peak**

As the encounter progresses, the [Graith](/being/species/graith.md)’s chanting intensifies, and the surrounding environment shifts. This marks the peak of their ritual. The area's pressure may fluctuate, creating pockets of intense cold or crushing force. The Drowner-Priest may unleash a powerful spell, attempting to fully claim the target of their attention.  This is the critical moment where the party must disrupt the ritual to prevent the final claim.

## Victory and Consequences

*   **Disrupting the Ritual:** If the party successfully disrupts the ritual, the [Graith](/being/species/graith.md) retreat, taking their claim incomplete. They do not necessarily become hostile but will likely observe the party closely, perhaps returning another time to complete their task. A feeling of being watched will linger.
*   **Complete Claim:** If the [Graith](/being/species/graith.md) complete their claim, the targeted individual or object disappears, seemingly absorbed by the sea. The party might experience a haunting sense of loss or guilt, depending on the nature of what was claimed.
*   **Alliance?:**  On rare occasions, the party might discover a shared goal with the [Graith](/being/species/graith.md) – perhaps aiding them in recovering a particularly valuable or meaningful artifact. This could lead to a tentative alliance, though the Graith remain enigmatic and untrustworthy.

## Thematic Considerations

*   **Loss and Grief:** The encounter should evoke a sense of loss and the enduring power of grief. The [Graith](/being/species/graith.md) are not inherently evil, but their methods are unsettling.
*   **The Sea's Claim:** The encounter highlights the sea’s power to claim what it desires. The party must acknowledge the sea's dominance and consider the consequences of disturbing its domain.
*   **Moral Ambiguity:** The [Graith](/being/species/graith.md)’s motives are not always clear-cut. The party might find themselves questioning whether the Graith are justified in their actions.
