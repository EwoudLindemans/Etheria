# Orinite: The Stabilizer

Orinite, revered as the Stabilizer, is a primordial force intimately tied to the reality of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md), particularly its resistance to the fluctuations and distortions caused by the presence of [the Dense](/generated/the-dense/the-dense.md). While Xylos is considered the source of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and change, Orinite represents equilibrium and the forces that bind reality together, preventing it from collapsing into chaotic instability.

## Origin and Nature

Legend speaks of Orinite as a [manifestation](/structure/chronological/event/manifestation.md) of the universeâ€™s inherent desire for order. In the genesis of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md), when the unbound energy of Xylos threatened to unravel existence, Orinite coalesced, a shimmering, unseen force that provided a counterweight. It is not a being in the traditional sense but rather a pervasive field of energy, detectable primarily through its effect on resonant frequencies and the manipulation of dimensional spaces.

Unlike Xylos, which reacts and adapts, Orinite *maintains*. It anchors objects and locations, resisting the shifting geometries and temporal anomalies that plague areas affected by [the Dense](/generated/the-dense/the-dense.md). Regions high in Orinite [resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) are inherently stable, resistant to magical interference, and exhibit a consistent flow of time.

## Connection to the Denseshifters

Crucially, Orinite is the very foundation upon which the art of Transitorium Densae is built. The Denseshifters' ritual, including the incantation
