# Social Strata of Iridia

[Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) society, while outwardly appearing diverse, is rigidly structured by a complex hierarchy largely dictated by one’s connection, perceived or real, to the magical [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) and the echoes of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)’s power. This system is interwoven with lineage, skill, and the degree to which one can harness or influence the inherent [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) within the land.

## The Scaleborn

At the apex of [Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) society are the **Scaleborn**, individuals who demonstrably draw significant power directly from a [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md). This connection isn't always inherited – while lineage plays a role, spontaneous [manifestations](/structure/chronological/event/manifestation.md) are recorded, often resulting in intense scrutiny and immediate elevation into this exclusive tier. Scaleborn power ranges from subtle enhancements to destructive abilities, dependent on the scale’s nature and the individual's aptitude. They traditionally hold positions of leadership in major cities, oversee crucial magical infrastructure, and often serve as conduits for understanding the lingering echoes of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md).  The Scaleborn are heavily courted by powerful merchant guilds and noble families, often acting as arbiters and strategic advisors. The **Council of Resonants**, composed of the most powerful Scaleborn from across [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md), convenes periodically to address threats and coordinate magical defenses.

## The Resonance Families

Below the Scaleborn, but still enjoying considerable prestige, are the **[Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) Families**. These lineages have, for generations, maintained a strong affinity for a particular [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) – often residing near it or developing rituals designed to amplify their connection. While they don't possess the direct power of the Scaleborn, they have cultivated extensive knowledge of scale-related [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and possess specialized skills like scale-refining, scale-inscription, and the construction of scale-powered artifacts. Membership in a [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Family grants significant social and economic advantages, ensuring access to valuable resources and political influence.
