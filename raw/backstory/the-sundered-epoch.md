# The Sundered Epoch: A Legacy of Shattered Skies and Whispering Stone

For millennia, the people of Aerthos knew only the Sky Pillars - colossal, crystalline structures of unknown origin that pierced the heavens. They weren’t merely geological formations; they pulsed with a tangible energy, regulating the flow of 'Aetherium,' the magical lifeblood of the world. Each Pillar was connected to a specific region, ensuring balanced growth, predictable seasons, and a flourishing ecosystem. Life was predictable, if somewhat stagnant, governed by the rhythmic ebb and flow of Aetherium.

## The Great Resonance and the Shattering

Then came the Great [Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md). Nobody definitively knows what triggered it. Some whisper of forbidden rituals, others of a celestial alignment, and a few, the oldest scholars, speak of a forgotten war between entities far older than Aerthos itself. Whatever the cause, a catastrophic wave of energy surged through the Sky Pillars. The gentle hum of Aetherium became a deafening roar, and the Pillars… fractured. 

Not all shattered entirely, but all were irrevocably damaged. Cracks spiderwebbed across their surfaces, the flow of Aetherium became erratic and volatile, and the once-steady seasons spiraled into unpredictable chaos. Great storms ravaged the lands, fertile fields turned barren overnight, and creatures mutated in horrifying ways, warped by the uncontrolled magical energies.

## The Age of Scars and Whispering Stone

The period following the [Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) is known as the Age of Scars – a time of devastation, adaptation, and the emergence of new power dynamics. With the Sky Pillars crippled, localized pockets of concentrated Aetherium began to form, becoming vital sources of power – and targets for conflict. These localized sources weren’t as readily accessible or as safely utilized as the pillars’ former, steady flow, leading to the rise of skilled Aetherium mages and the development of complex arcane technologies.

More significantly, the fractured Sky Pillars began to *whisper*.  Ancient, fragmented memories, warnings, and prophecies seeped from the cracks, occasionally manifesting as visions or cryptic clues.  Those sensitive enough to hear – 'Resonants' – became invaluable, hunted by kingdoms and factions eager to exploit their abilities.  These whispers hint at a lost history, a forgotten purpose for the Pillars, and a growing threat linked to the very source of Aetherium. The language spoken by the Sky Pillars is known as the Stone Tongue and its translation is currently ongoing, but initial progress has been made with rudimentary translation.

## Rise of the Stoneforgers

Desperate to harness the fractured Aetherium and comprehend the Whispers, a new order emerged: the Stoneforgers. These individuals dedicated their lives to the study of the fractured Pillars, developing techniques to channel, stabilize, and even *shape* the raw Aetherium flowing from them. Their skills allowed them to craft powerful artifacts – Aetherium conduits, resonating armor, and even tools that amplified a Resonant’s ability to interpret the Whispers. However, the process is dangerous, and many Stoneforgers are consumed by the very energies they seek to control. Rumours even tell that certain powerful Forgers have learned to weave the whispers into living stone, creating guardians and constructs of immense power.

The order are heavily sought after by those in power, given their abilities to both extract Aetherium and decipher the Whispers, making many ambitious and corrupt individuals attempt to control the stoneforgers.

## The Unveiling of the 'Deep Zones'

As the chaos escalated, explorers and scholars started investigating the newly formed rifts and cracks – what they call the 'Deep Zones'. These are bizarre dimensional pockets, formed by the instability of Aetherium, that contain echoes of other realities. Some zones are relatively benign, offering unique resources or glimpses of lost civilizations. Others are infested with aberrant creatures and warped landscapes, posing a deadly threat to anyone who dares to venture in.

One Deep Zone, known as the Obsidian Labyrinth, is rumored to contain the 'Heart of the First Pillar,' a powerful artifact that might hold the key to restoring the Sky Pillars – or unleashing a cataclysm of unimaginable proportions. Multiple factions are scrambling to locate it, leading to dangerous expeditions and betrayals.

## Current Tensions and the Shadow of the Past

The nations of Aerthos are locked in a precarious balance of power, vying for control of dwindling Aetherium resources and valuable Deep Zone locations. Old alliances have crumbled, and new rivalries have emerged. The whispers from the fractured Pillars offer glimpses of a looming darkness – a forgotten entity that slumbered beneath Aerthos before the [Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md), now stirring once more.  The fate of the world hangs in the balance, resting on the shoulders of those brave – or foolish – enough to unravel the secrets of the Sundered Epoch.
