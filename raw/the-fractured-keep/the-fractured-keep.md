# The Fractured Keep

[The Fractured Keep](/geography/realm/the-fractured-keep.md), known locally as “The Shattered Tooth” is a sprawling ruin perched precariously on the rim of the [Mountains of Triz](/geography/region/mountains-of-triz.md), overlooking the vast expanse of the Rendishing Night Desert. Once a formidable fortress and the ancestral seat of the now-vanished Order of the Obsidian Veil, it’s now a treacherous labyrinth of crumbling towers, echoing halls, and shifting passages, haunted by whispers of the past and the lingering echoes of magical energies.

## History and the Order of the Obsidian Veil

For centuries, the Order of the Obsidian Veil maintained a vigilant watch over the region, renowned for their mastery of protective wards and arcane defenses. They served as a shield against the dangers emanating from [The Dense](/generated/the-dense/the-dense.md) and guarded ancient knowledge pertaining to the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) and their power. Their fortress was built to channel and amplify the power of the [Umperas Hull](/geography/scale/umperas-hull.md), drawing energy from its curvature and incorporating it into their defensive systems. Legends claim the Order delved too deeply into forbidden knowledge, attempting to bind the residual essence of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md) that resided within the Umperas Hull. The ensuing catastrophic magical backlash, known as “The Sundering,” obliterated the Order, shattered the Keep, and opened rifts in reality.

## Current State & Hazards

The Keep is now a dangerously unstable structure. Constant tremors shake its foundations, causing sections to collapse unpredictably. Magical anomalies are commonplace: zones of distorted gravity, pockets of blinding light, and echoes of the Order’s rituals occasionally manifest. The shifting passages are not only physically treacherous but also spatially disorienting; a traveler can easily wander in circles or find themselves transported to entirely different sections of the Keep. Further complicating matters, the Keep is infested with mutated wildlife – the result of exposure to the disrupted magical energies – and animated stone guardians, remnants of the Order’s defenses, who relentlessly patrol their designated areas.
