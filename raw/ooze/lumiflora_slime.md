# Lumiflora Slime

## Description and Biology

The Lumiflora Slime is a unique and unsettling form of sentient ooze found primarily within the deeper chasms and caverns beneath the *[Mountains of Triz](/geography/region/mountains-of-triz.md)*. Unlike most oozes which are purely predatory, the Lumiflora Slime displays a symbiotic relationship with a bioluminescent flora, resulting in a mesmerizing, yet deceptive, existence. These slimes appear as pulsating masses of translucent green, interwoven with strands of vibrant, glowing flowers. The flowers aren’t merely decorative; they actively absorb ambient magical energy—specifically the lingering echoes of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)’s power found permeating the *[scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md)*—and convert it into a form of sustenance for the slime itself. 

The slime's gelatinous body is unusually resilient, exhibiting a high resistance to physical damage. It constantly secretes a viscous fluid that not only protects it but also promotes the growth and spread of the glowing flora it hosts. This constant expansion leads Lumiflora Slimes to gradually consume surrounding organic matter, though they display a distinct preference for mineral deposits rich in rare earth elements – resources valuable to the [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md)' experiments. Their size can vary greatly, with the largest specimens rivaling the dimensions of a small cave. 

## Connection to Lore and Religions

The Lumiflora Slime's existence is intrinsically linked to the lingering magical energy released from the *[scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md)*, providing a fascinating example of how life adapts and evolves within [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md)'s unique environment.  The *Followers of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)* view these slimes with a mixture of reverence and concern. While they acknowledge the slimes' ability to harness Irion's lingering essence, they fear the potential for uncontrolled growth and the disruption of the balance of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) in the land. Rumours whisper that some within the Follower's order are attempting to cultivate Lumiflora Slimes in controlled environments, hoping to refine their ability to absorb and redirect magical energies, believing it holds the key to unlocking deeper understanding of Irion’s powers. 

However, the *[Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md)* are far more interested in exploiting these creatures. Their ability to concentrate ambient [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) makes Lumiflora Slime’s bodies highly sought after for alchemical processes and magical enhancements. Several members of the Arcane Fangs have attempted to extract the bioluminescent flora, and integrate them into their own bodies and gear, hoping to gain a constant source of magical power. These attempts have often resulted in disastrous consequences, due to the Flora’s unpredictable behaviour and the Lumiflora Slime's surprisingly sharp intelligence and aggressive defenses. 

## Behaviour and Combat

Lumiflora Slimes are generally passive unless provoked or threatened. They exhibit a surprising level of intelligence, demonstrating problem-solving abilities and a capacity for rudimentary communication through pulsating patterns of light. When agitated, a Lumiflora Slime will emit a blinding flash of bioluminescence, followed by a series of corrosive, acidic sprays. These sprays not only inflict physical damage but also sap magical energy, hindering spellcasting abilities. Larger specimens can also attempt to engulf their opponents, slowly dissolving them within their acidic embrace. Their bodies are also difficult to damage by magical means, due to their ability to absorb and redirect magical energy. 

## Notable Specimens

*   **The Emerald Heart:** A particularly large and ancient Lumiflora Slime residing deep within the [Mountains of Triz](/geography/region/mountains-of-triz.md), rumoured to possess an unparalleled ability to absorb and redirect magical energies. It is said to be guarded by a network of interconnected flora, creating a living labyrinth of glowing vines and acidic sprays.
*   **The Wandering Bloom:**  A smaller, more nomadic Lumiflora Slime observed moving between the cracks between Morakai and Xaratius - theorized to be feeding off the magical flux that surges between continents.
