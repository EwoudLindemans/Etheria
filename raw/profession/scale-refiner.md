# Scale-Refiner

[Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-Refiners are highly specialized artisans and technicians responsible for extracting, purifying, and manipulating the crystalline energies harvested from the world’s magical Scales. Their profession stands at the intersection of arcane knowledge, meticulous craftsmanship, and a touch of controlled risk, as improper handling of Scale-derived energies can lead to volatile and dangerous results.

## Origins and Training

The first [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-Refiners emerged in the wake of the Great Collapse, when the world’s Scales began to visibly fracture and leak raw magical energy. Initially, these individuals were scavengers and tinkerers attempting to understand and utilize the strange power. Over time, formalized guilds and academies arose to standardize techniques and enforce safety protocols. The most prestigious training grounds are located in [Triz Valley](/geography/settlement/city/triz-valley.md), renowned for its natural abundance of Scale fragments, and within the tightly controlled workshops of [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md), where the specialized light emitted by the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md) is incorporated into the refining process.

Formal training spans several years and comprises three core disciplines:

*   **Crystalline [Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) Theory:** Understanding the intricate vibrational patterns within different [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) types and their reaction to various forms of energy. A deep understanding of Crystalline [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Theory is essential for predicting and mitigating the potential hazards of Scale manipulation.
*   **Energetic Extraction and Purification:** Mastering the techniques for safely extracting raw energy from [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) fragments and purifying it through a series of intricate alchemical processes and crystalline filters. This involves precise control over temperature, pressure, and the application of focused light and sound waves.
*   **[Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) Integration and Application:** Applying refined Scale energies into tangible forms, such as enhancing tools, imbuing weapons, creating magical trinkets, and even supplementing the healing properties of medicines. This often requires a degree of artistic skill and an understanding of how different Scale energies interact with living beings and materials.

## Scale Specialties & Tiering

[Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-Refiners often specialize in working with specific Scale types, leading to various sub-professions:

*   **Asara Lumineers:** Skilled in working with [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md) fragments, focusing on light manipulation and healing applications. They are highly sought after in [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md) and surrounding regions.
*   **Hull Forgers:** Experts in shaping and integrating [Umperas Hull](/geography/scale/umperas-hull.md) fragments into durable materials and protective gear, prized by warriors and mercenaries.
*   **Ornite Conduit:**  The rarest and most specialized, these artisans focus on harnessing the unique energy patterns of the [Ornite Ring](/geography/scale/ornite-ring.md), though the practice is perilous and poorly understood.

Refiners are tiered based on their skill and experience, measured by the '[Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) Quotient' (RQ):

*   **Novice (RQ 0-10):**  Capable of basic purification and energy extraction under close supervision.
*   **Journeyman (RQ 11-30):**  Able to work independently on standard refinement tasks and possesses a basic understanding of [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) interaction.
*   **Master (RQ 31-50):** Highly skilled and sought after for complex refinement procedures. They often lead workshops and mentor apprentices.
*   **Grandmaster (RQ 51+):** Exceptionally rare individuals who possess an unparalleled understanding of [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) energies and the ability to push the boundaries of refinement techniques. Their expertise is often sought by royalty, powerful guilds, and the most secretive research facilities.
