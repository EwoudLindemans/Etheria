# Brazen Brew

## Origin & Creation

The [Brazen Brew](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/consumable/brazen-brew.md) isn’s merely a drink; it’s a legend whispered amongst weary travelers, a badge of honor for the daring, and a frequent source of regret for those who underestimate its potency. Born from the chaotic heart of [the Brazen Burp](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-brazen-burp.md) tavern, its accidental creation story is as infamous as its effects.

According to tavern lore, during a particularly fierce brawl between dwarven miners and rogue goblins (a recurring event), a disgruntled brewer, Bogrum the Booming, seeking revenge for a spilled keg, decided to combine any leftover ingredients he could find in a desperate attempt to disorient his adversaries. Whiskey, cider, gin, stout beer, and… a curiously persistent splash of goblin blood (added for ‘bite’, Bogrum allegedly mumbled) ended up in a large, unmarked vat. The resulting concoction was initially deemed a failure—a murky, foul-smelling mess. However, when a particularly courageous (or foolish) dwarf, in the heat of battle, took a swig, a strange calm descended upon the tavern. The fighting subsided, replaced by a wave of bizarre camaraderie and an uncontrollable urge to share the strange brew with everyone present.

## Composition & Brewing Process

While the core ingredients remain consistent – whiskey for strength, cider for a deceptive sweetness, gin for madness, stout for fortitude, and a splash of animal blood – Bogrum's legacy is maintained through subtle variations depending on the season and the availability of rarer components. Modern-day braves at the [Brazen Brew](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/consumable/brazen-brew.md) follow Bogrum's basic recipe with slight additions: 

*   **Moonflower Honey:** Added during the new moon to amplify the brew's euphoric effects. 
*   **Dragon Pepper Dust:** A rare spice added for a fiery kick that lingers long after the initial warmth dissipates.  *Only* used by the head brewer, Borin Stoutheart.  
*   **Gnomish Glowmoss:** Fermented into the brew to lend a shimmering, almost phosphorescent quality in dimly lit environments.  

The brewing process itself is more of an art than a science. The mixture is fermented in specially crafted, reinforced casks made from Heartwood oak—sourced only from the northern reaches of [Triz Valley](/geography/settlement/city/triz-valley.md)—then aged for a minimum of three lunar cycles in the tavern's cellar, which is rumored to be built atop an ancient, slumbering earth elemental.

## Effects & Consumption

Consuming [Brazen Brew](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/consumable/brazen-brew.md) is a precarious gamble. Its potency shifts subtly with each batch, influenced by the ingredients and the brewer's mood. However, the general spectrum of effects is well documented by generations of imbibers:

*   **First Mug:** A warm embrace of courage. Inhibitions loosen, and stories flow freely. Perception may subtly skew towards the optimistic.
*   **Second Mug:** Spontaneous declarations of friendship and promises to slay dragons together. Conversations become animated, and dancing is almost unavoidable.
*   **Third Mug:** Visions of past, present, and potential futures—though their accuracy is dubious at best. A profound sense of connection to the universe may be experienced, followed by a sudden, irresistible urge to sing sea shanties.
*   **Fourth Mug (Not Recommended):**  Reality begins to unravel.  The drinker may perceive conversations with inanimate objects, believe they can fly, or attempt to negotiate peace treaties with the tavern’s resident swarm of perpetually annoyed houseflies.

**Side Effects May Include:** Temporary deafness, spontaneous combustion (rare, but documented), an uncontrollable desire to tell riddles, and an overwhelming sense of profound understanding of everything, followed by a complete inability to remember anything the next morning.

## Legal Status & Distribution

[Brazen Brew](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/consumable/brazen-brew.md) is legal in most regions, though several cities have implemented regulations regarding public consumption (particularly in regions where spontaneous combustion incidents have been reported). Distribution is primarily through [the Brazen Burp](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-brazen-burp.md) Tavern, but a few select merchants—often with questionable connections—have managed to procure limited quantities for sale.  Importing the beverage into the [Glimmering Ashenburrow](/geography/settlement/city/glimmering-ashenburrow.md) is strictly prohibited, a regulation enforced by the local authorities due to a previous incident involving a runaway gnome and a hot air balloon.

## Price

*   One Mug: 7 Silver Pieces
*   A Barrel (50 Mugs): 200 Silver Pieces (negotiable with Borin Stoutheart)
