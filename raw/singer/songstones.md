# Songstones: Echoes of the Deep

Across Or and beyond, bards and storytellers are common, but few possess the rare ability to utilize Songstones – naturally resonant crystals that amplify and preserve melodic memory. While many possess a voice, true Singers are those who forge a bond with a Songstone, using it to channel and weave resonant echoes into their performances. 

## What are Songstones?

Songstones are geological anomalies, found primarily in the Shadow Mountains bordering [Triz Valley](/geography/settlement/city/triz-valley.md), though scattered fragments appear across Or's diverse landscapes. They are believed to be formed by ancient, forgotten energies – remnants of a time when the land itself sang, according to legends whispered amongst the [Tankard Trekkers](/structure/society/profession/tankard-trekkers.md). A Songstone isn’t merely a crystal; it’s a repository of captured sound, a memory etched into its very structure.

Each Songstone possesses a unique ‘[resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) signature’ – a melodic imprint that dictates the type of sound it best carries. Some amplify joyous folk tunes, others carry the mournful cries of ancestral spirits, and still others hum with unsettling, unknown harmonies. Identifying a Songstone's [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) requires a keen ear and, often, the guidance of an experienced Stone Whisperer.

## The Role of the Singer

A Singer doesn't *create* the music, but rather *unleashes* it. When a Singer bonds with a Songstone, they establish a symbiotic link, allowing the crystal to imbue their voice with its stored melodies. This isn't simple amplification; it’s a process of resonant transfer. The Songstone’s history flows into the Singer’s performance, layering ancestral voices and forgotten rhythms onto their own.

Becoming a Singer isn’t a matter of talent, but of attunement. It requires years of meditative practice, deep understanding of musical theory (particularly ancient harmonic [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md)), and a profound respect for the power of sound. Many aspirants fail, unable to overcome the crystal's resistance or manage the influx of resonant energy.  A failed attunement can leave a Singer permanently tone-deaf or, in extreme cases, inflict a debilitating form of ‘resonant echo’ – a constant, distracting hum in the mind.

## Songstone Traditions

### The Shadow Mountain Harmonists: </h3>
The largest community of Singers resides near the Shadow Mountains. They maintain vast libraries of Songstones, carefully cataloging their unique [resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) signatures and passing down their knowledge through generations. Their performances are legendary, weaving elaborate sonic tapestries that evoke ancient battles, forgotten rituals, and the slow march of seasons.  They are particularly skilled in ‘Echo Weaving’ – combining the [resonances](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) of multiple Songstones to create complex, multi-layered compositions.

### The Wandering Echoes: </h3>
These solitary Singers travel the land, seeking out forgotten Songstones in crumbling ruins and ancient groves. They trade in resonant memories, performing for small audiences in taverns and marketplaces, often offering glimpses into the past.  Many are rumored to seek the legendary 'First Songstone', said to contain the song of Or's creation.

### The Silent Chorus: </h3>
A secretive order of Singers who have forsaken verbal song, utilizing Songstones to project purely instrumental melodies.  They are often seen in remote locations, performing at dawn or dusk, their music said to possess the power to soothe tormented spirits and mend broken landscapes.

## Notable Songstones & Legends

* **The Lament of Lost Kings:**  A darkly resonant Songstone said to capture the mournful cries of ancient rulers overthrown in a forgotten war.  It is said its melodies induce profound sorrow and reveal buried secrets.
* **The Weaver's Song:**  A vibrant Songstone that encourages creativity and inspires artistic expression.  It is rumored to be found within the ruins of the old [Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) workshop.
* **The First Songstone:** The most sought-after artifact, said to hold the primal song of Or’s creation. It is supposedly hidden in a location known only to the Silent Chorus.
