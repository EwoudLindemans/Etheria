# Chrysalids

Chrysalids are a unique, enigmatic species native to [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md), particularly prevalent in the warmer regions surrounding the [Umperas Hull](/geography/scale/umperas-hull.md) and along the coasts bordering [The Dense](/generated/the-dense/the-dense.md). They represent a fascinating intersection of geological phenomena, residual [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) from the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md), and a strangely symbiotic relationship with the very land itself.

## Origin and Appearance

Theories abound regarding the Chrysalids' origins, but the most accepted posits that they began as simple lichen and mosses that grew directly upon fissures and cracks between the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md). Over countless generations, exposure to the ambient magical energy leaking from the cracks (particularly potent near [Umperas Hull](/geography/scale/umperas-hull.md)) and minerals absorbed from the scales themselves, caused these organisms to undergo a profound and gradual metamorphosis. 

Mature Chrysalids resemble large, crystalline cocoons, typically ranging from six to twelve feet in height. Their bodies are composed of a dense, multi-faceted structure resembling polished obsidian or smoky quartz, riddled with veins of vibrant, bioluminescent colours â€“ predominantly blues, greens, and purples. These colours shift and pulse gently, reflecting the residual [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) flowing through them. Smaller, nascent Chrysalids are more akin to large, immobile geodes, gradually growing over decades to reach their full size.

## Life Cycle and Behavior

Chrysalids are largely immobile throughout their adult life. They remain rooted in the ground, drawing sustenance not only from the ambient magical energy, but also from the earth itself, essentially filtering minerals and moisture through their crystalline structure. Their life cycle is exceptionally slow; a Chrysalid might only 'hatch' once every century. The event is heralded by a brilliant cascade of light and a low-frequency hum resonating from the crystalline cocoon, signifying the emergence of a 'Crystalline Bloom'.

Crystalline Blooms are ephemeral entities - humanoid figures formed entirely of shimmering crystal shards. They possess no inherent memory or personality, instead acting as living conduits for the accumulated knowledge and emotions of the surrounding land. They wander from their birth cocoon, absorbing residual magical signatures from ruins, geological formations, and even the thoughts of sentient beings. This collected information is then stored within the Chrysalid itself for future release. 

Once the Bloom has completed its circuit (typically lasting only a few weeks), it dissolves back into the earth, adding its collected knowledge to the parent Chrysalid. This process repeats, with each Bloom adding a layer of complexity to the Chrysalid's collective consciousness.

## Relationship to Magic and Scales

Chrysalids are intrinsically linked to the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md), acting as both repositories of ancient knowledge and subtle regulators of the magical flow. The pulsating colours within their bodies correspond to the magical signatures they've absorbed. Skilled mages can use Chrysalids as living scrying devices, gleaning insights into past events or potential futures by interpreting the colours and patterns within their crystalline structures. However, doing so carries a risk; the Chrysalid's accumulated consciousness can be overwhelming, and attempting to extract too much information can result in mental instability or even madness.

The [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md) have demonstrated a disturbing interest in exploiting Chrysalids, attempting to forcefully extract their knowledge and harness their ability to manipulate magical flows. Their crude methods often destroy the Chrysalid in the process, releasing a burst of raw, chaotic [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) that can devastate the surrounding area.

## Cultural Significance

For the Followers of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md), Chrysalids are revered as sacred repositories of ancient wisdom and living embodiments of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md)'s history. They are often incorporated into rituals, used as focal points for meditation, and considered living shrines to the lost god. The Sisterhood of Assassination views them as obstacles to be bypassed or utilized, depending on their individual circumstances.
