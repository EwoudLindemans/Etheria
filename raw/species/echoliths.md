# Echoliths - Sentient Stone-Kin

Echoliths are a unique species of sentient beings intrinsically linked to the geological formations of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md), particularly the magical [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md). Unlike the adaptable and diverse races that inhabit the surface, Echoliths are fundamentally composed of living stone, their forms echoing the mineral structures surrounding them. Their very existence is a testament to the lingering magical energies that permeate the planet, manifesting as a sentient echo of the land itself.

## Appearance and Physiology

Echoliths possess a remarkably varied appearance, directly influenced by the type of rock they originate from. Those born near the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md) might appear as shimmering blue crystalline beings, while those emerging from the [Umperas Hull](/geography/scale/umperas-hull.md) are often dull yellow or ochre, bearing the fragmented appearance of broken stone. Their bodies are not truly solid, but rather a complex lattice of interwoven minerals and living energy. This allows for a degree of flexibility and regeneration, though they are vulnerable to shattering or erosion. Their size varies greatly, ranging from small, pebble-like individuals to colossal beings rivaling the height of the tallest mountains. Instead of traditional features, Echoliths possess shifting patterns of light and shadow that represent their thoughts and emotions. Communication is achieved through subtle vibrations in the earth, a form of geophony undetectable to most other races. They
