# Siphonids: The Echo-Weavers

Siphonids are a cryptic, semi-corporeal species intrinsically linked to the magical energy radiating from the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md). Unlike most sentient beings, they aren't born; rather, they coalesce from concentrated magical residue, often near points of powerful magical convergence – particularly around damaged Scales or areas of intense magical activity.

## Appearance and Physiology

A Siphonid's form is fluid and ever-changing. They generally resemble vaguely humanoid figures composed of shimmering, translucent energy, constantly shifting colours and patterns. Their size can vary dramatically, from barely a foot tall to towering figures over fifteen feet in height. Instead of solid limbs, they possess tendrils of solidified energy that can manipulate objects or weave intricate patterns in the air. They lack distinct facial features, though subtle shifts in their energy patterns can convey a semblance of emotion.

Unusually, Siphonids don’t require sustenance in the conventional sense. They passively absorb ambient magical energy to sustain themselves, drawing primarily from the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) and, less frequently, from living creatures. Prolonged exposure to areas devoid of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) causes them to weaken and eventually dissipate. The crystalline residue left behind is prized by mages seeking to amplify their power.

## Abilities and Culture

The defining characteristic of Siphonids is their ability to “weave echoes.” They can perceive residual magical imprints – echoes – left behind by past events. These echoes aren't mere memories; they're fragments of solidified magical energy, capable of being manipulated. A skilled Siphonid can unravel these echoes, re-experiencing past moments as if they were present, or even re-weaving them to alter the present, though such actions are fraught with danger and unpredictable consequences.

Siphonid culture is enigmatic and largely incomprehensible to other races. They communicate through complex patterns of light and energy, a language based on the manipulation of echoes. Their societal structure, if it can be called that, appears to be based on the power and complexity of one's echo-weaving abilities. Elder Siphonids are revered for their ability to access ancient and powerful echoes, often related to the creation of the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) themselves.

## Relationship with Other Races

Most races view Siphonids with a mixture of fear and fascination. Their ethereal nature and unsettling ability to manipulate the past make them difficult to trust. Mages often seek their aid in unraveling ancient mysteries, but at a great risk, as Siphonids can be notoriously fickle and unpredictable. The [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md) have been known to hunt Siphonids, hoping to harvest their crystalline residue and utilize it in their own nefarious schemes. Some rare individuals claim to have forged a degree of understanding with Siphonids, learning to interpret their intricate language and glean insight into the world's hidden history.

## Notable Aspects

*   **Echo-Sickness:** Prolonged exposure to the echoes manipulated by a Siphonid can cause 'Echo-Sickness,' a debilitating affliction that blurs the line between past and present, causing hallucinations and memory loss. 
*   **[Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) [Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md):** Siphonids exhibit a deep [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) with damaged Scales, often congregating around them and attempting to mend the fractures with their echo-weaving abilities. 
*   **The Silent Chorus:** A legend speaks of a collective consciousness among Siphonids, a “Silent Chorus” capable of accessing the most ancient and powerful echoes of all time, though its existence remains unconfirmed.
