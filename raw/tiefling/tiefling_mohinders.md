# Tieflings of Mohinders: A Divided Heritage

Within the fractured city of [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md), the tiefling population occupies a unique and often precarious position. Their innate connection to the Spiral, often perceived as a mark of corruption or demonic influence, makes them both targets of suspicion and vital conduits for navigating the city's esoteric power sources.  Unlike their kin in other regions, the tieflings of Mohinders have become deeply intertwined with the portal system and the political divide that now defines the city's existence.

## The Whispers of the Spiral

The majority of tieflings in [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md) trace their lineage to a long-forgotten schism within the Church of Pelor, where a small sect experimented with harnessing the energy of the Spiral to heal and empower its followers. These attempts, however well-intentioned, inadvertently drew the attention of lesser entities from the Abyss, resulting in the birth of numerous tieflings.  This history is carefully guarded, whispered only amongst older generations, as the Council views it as evidence of the inherent dangers of meddling with forces beyond mortal understanding.  Consequently, many tieflings deliberately obscure their origins, fearing discrimination or even persecution.

## Divided Loyalties

The political division of [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md) has profoundly impacted tiefling society. While some tieflings find solace and opportunity within the rigid structure of the Council, finding roles as Rune Wardens (due to their inherent resistance to magical interference) or serving as intermediaries with less reputable Spiral entities, others have embraced the revolutionary fervor of the Veilbreakers.  These tieflings believe their connection to the Spiral grants them a unique insight into the city's oppressive system and see the Veilbreakers’ mission of dismantling the Council as a chance to liberate not just themselves, but all of Mohinders.  However, this alliance comes at a cost; the Veilbreakers frequently task their tiefling agents with navigating dangerous routes through unstable portals, risking entanglement with the Spiral’s darker aspects.

## The Portal Weavers

A rare and highly prized subset of [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md)' tiefling population are the 'Portal Weavers.' These individuals, possessing an innate sensitivity to the fluctuations of the city’s arcane network, are able to subtly manipulate and stabilize existing portals, allowing for safer passage and mitigating the risk of becoming lost in the Spiral. This ability is fiercely sought after by both the Council and the Veilbreakers, resulting in a tense competition for their services. The most skilled Portal Weavers are rumored to be able to detect the telltale signatures of corrupted or manipulated portals, and are therefore highly valued as troubleshooters and security specialists. Training as a Portal Weaver is a perilous undertaking, requiring years of rigorous study and risking permanent Spiral entanglement.

## Physical Adaptations and Cultural Traits

Beyond the standard tiefling traits, those born and raised in [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md) often display unique physical adaptations: 

*   **Shimmering Markings:** Many tieflings in [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md) exhibit shifting patterns of faintly glowing markings on their skin, which intensify when near active portals or when using their connection to the Spiral. This is believed to be a result of prolonged exposure to the city's unstable arcane energy.
*   **Resilience to Void Drift:** Exposure to the erratic energy of failed portal attempts has resulted in an increased resilience to “Void Drift” – a disorienting phenomenon that can affect those who venture too close to dimensional rifts.

Culturally, [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md)’ tieflings maintain a complex relationship with their infernal heritage. While acknowledging their connection to the Abyss, they actively reject the notion of inherent evil, striving to build a life of purpose and belonging within the fractured city. Elaborate rituals involving intricate portal glyphs and carefully controlled Spiral energy are central to their spiritual practices, serving as a means of honoring their lineage while safeguarding against the dangers it represents.
