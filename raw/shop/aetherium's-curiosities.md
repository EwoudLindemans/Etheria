# Aetherium's Curiosities

Aetherium’s Curiosities is less a shop and more a contained explosion of potential, nestled (precariously) within a converted mine shaft off [Gutterbrew Alley](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/gutterbrew-alley.md). Run by the enigmatic gnome, Fizzwick Aetherium, the shop deals in rare alchemical ingredients, salvaged arcane components, and the occasional 'one-of-a-kind' creation that’s best approached with caution.

## Overview

Unlike the rowdy, pop-up stalls of [Gutterbrew Alley](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/gutterbrew-alley.md), Aetherium’s is surprisingly organised – if you can decipher Fizzwick's chaotic labelling system. Shelves overflow with shimmering powders, bubbling vials, and odd contraptions humming with barely contained energies. Fizzwick’s specialty is acquiring items lost or discarded by larger alchemical enterprises – the forgotten footnotes of breakthrough discoveries, the rejected prototypes, the experimental components deemed 'too unstable.'

## Inventory Highlights

*   **Essence of Chronoflux:** A shimmering, unstable liquid rumored to briefly accelerate or decelerate time in a localized area. (Fizzwick claims it’s only slightly volatile.)
*   **Salvaged Rune Fragments:** Broken pieces of powerful runes salvaged from collapsed constructs. Can be incorporated into enchantments, but require considerable skill to bind effectively.
*   **Echoing Gears:** Tiny, intricately crafted gears that subtly alter the sound frequencies of anything they touch. Useful for discreet communication or subtle sonic manipulation.
*   **Unidentified Bloom Samples:** Exotic plant specimens harvested from uncharted regions. Potentially hallucinogenic, poisonous, or brimming with magical properties – Fizzwick isn't entirely sure, and isn't telling.
*   **The 'Whirr-Click' Device:** A bizarre, clockwork device of unknown purpose. Emits a constant whirring and clicking noise, and is guaranteed to attract curious gnomes. (Fizzwick says it's perfectly safe… mostly.)

## Fizzwick Aetherium - Proprietor

Fizzwick is a small, jittery gnome with perpetually stained fingers and an unnerving ability to identify any alchemical substance with a single sniff. He speaks in rapid-fire bursts, frequently interrupting himself with bursts of manic laughter or rambling explanations of complex theories. While undeniably eccentric, Fizzwick is a remarkably shrewd businessman, always able to negotiate a favorable price – often while subtly trying to sell you something you didn't know you needed.

## Location and Access

*   **Precise Location:** A hidden entrance disguised as a crumbling brick wall accessible only through a narrow passage off [Gutterbrew Alley](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/gutterbrew-alley.md), marked by a single flickering lantern.
*   **Directions:** Ask around [Gutterbrew Alley](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/gutterbrew-alley.md) – but be prepared to pay a small finder's fee.
*   **Warning:** The entrance is prone to collapse, so step carefully.
