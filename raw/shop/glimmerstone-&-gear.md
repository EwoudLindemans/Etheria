# Glimmerstone & Gear
> *“Where the practical meets the peculiar.”*

## Overview

Glimmerstone & Gear is a unique shop nestled within the bustling [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md), renowned for its eclectic mix of practical adventuring gear and shimmering, often magical, trinkets. Located near the entrance to [Gutterbrew Alley](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/gutterbrew-alley.md), it’s become a landmark for those seeking both reliable equipment and a touch of the extraordinary. The shop's proprietor, a gruff but knowledgeable dwarf named Borin Stonebeard, is known for his discerning eye and his ability to identify genuine magical artifacts from clever imitations.

## Inventory & Specializations

Borin’s shop caters to a wide range of clientele, from seasoned adventurers to curious townsfolk. While stocking standard fare like rope, climbing gear, and basic weapons, Glimmerstone & Gear’s true specialty lies in procuring rare and unusual items. Expect to find:

*   **Enchanted Tools:** Shovels that dig faster, axes that never dull, picks that whisper directions to veins of ore. Many are recovered from [Gutterbrew Alley](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/gutterbrew-alley.md)'s inhabitants, and are of questionable quality.
*   **Glimmerstones:** Naturally occurring crystals that pulse with faint light and subtle [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md). Borin is a recognised authority on them, able to identify their properties and potential uses. He sells them raw or incorporated into rings, amulets, and other jewelry.
*   **Recovered Artifacts:** Borin’s contacts within the underworld and his occasional forays into the forgotten corners of the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md) often turn up unusual artifacts—broken automatons, partially-charged amulets, and cryptic scrolls. He charges a premium for these, but guarantees their authenticity (mostly).
*   **Alchemical Supplies:** A limited selection of basic alchemical ingredients and simple potions, catering to those who prefer to brew their own. The quality is decent, but Borin warns against experimenting too wildly.
*   **Oddities & Curiosities:** A constantly changing assortment of trinkets and baubles—singing pebbles, self-stirring mugs, miniature automatons, and other peculiar items that defy easy categorization.

## Proprietor: Borin Stonebeard

Borin is a stout, weathered dwarf with a perpetually grumpy expression. He's known for his blunt honesty, his gruff demeanor, and his surprisingly sharp wit. Despite his outward cynicism, he genuinely cares about his customers, offering expert advice and fair prices (within reason). He’s often found tinkering with some new discovery in the back of the shop, surrounded by wires, crystals, and half-finished projects.

## Rumors & Lore

*   It's rumored Borin once recovered a fragment of the fabled [Asarazul](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/asarazul.md), but sold it for a considerable sum.
*   Borin’s connections with [Gutterbrew Alley](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/gutterbrew-alley.md)’s inhabitants are extensive, some even suggest he occasionally commissions experimental items from eccentric brewers.
*   There's a persistent rumour that Borin knows the location of a forgotten dwarven cache somewhere within the mines – though he vehemently denies it.
