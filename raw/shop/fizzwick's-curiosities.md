# Fizzwick's Curiosities

## Overview

Nestled within the vibrant chaos of [Gutterbrew Alley](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/gutterbrew-alley.md), Fizzwick’s Curiosities stands out – not for its decor (which is, frankly, a haphazard collection of salvaged materials and sparking wires), but for its *contents*. Owned and operated by the eccentric gnome, Professor Elric Fizzwick, the shop is a haven for anyone seeking the unusual, the experimental, or the outright bizarre. While most establishments in Gutterbrew Alley focus on consumable concoctions, Fizzwick’s offers a rotating stock of gadgets, alchemical components, and half-finished inventions, all carefully (or not-so-carefully) categorized and priced.

## Inventory & Specializations

Fizzwick's isn't your typical mercantile establishment. Expect the unexpected. Inventory changes daily, depending on Professor Fizzwick’s latest discoveries and experiments. Here are some commonly found categories:

*   **Alchemical Components:** Rare herbs, crystallized mana fragments, phosphorescent moss, and other ingredients sought by master potion-makers.  Quality is...variable.
*   **Gadgets & Gizmos:** From self-stirring teacups to miniature wind-up automatons, Fizzwick’s boasts a selection of curious mechanical devices. Many are prototypes and may malfunction spectacularly.
*   **Semi-Functional Inventions:** A rotating display of half-finished projects—goggles that supposedly reveal auras, boots that amplify jumps (sometimes too much), and musical instruments that play unexpected harmonies.
*   **“Lost & Found” Artifacts:**  Oddities recovered from expeditions, abandoned labs, and the deepest corners of [Gutterbrew Alley](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/gutterbrew-alley.md).  Origins are often unknown, and caution is advised.
*   **Fizzwick’s Personal Projects:**  A small corner dedicated to the Professor's current experiments, often available for sale (at a considerable risk and a higher price).

## The Professor Himself

Professor Elric Fizzwick is a whirlwind of energy and enthusiasm, often covered in soot and trailing sparks. He’s a brilliant, if somewhat scatterbrained, inventor, perpetually tinkering with new ideas and eager to discuss them with anyone who's willing to listen. While he's generally helpful and jovial, he’s also known to become intensely focused on his work, occasionally forgetting customers are present.

## Reputation & Lore

*   **Price Range:**  Varies wildly, from a few coppers for a simple gear to several gold crowns for a prototype invention with questionable stability.
*   **Local Rumor:** Fizzwick’s is said to contain a secret compartment—a hidden workshop where the Professor builds his most ambitious (and potentially dangerous) projects.
