# The Crooked Cog & Quill

## Overview

The Crooked Cog & Quill is a curious establishment nestled within the bustling heart of [Coalwalk Row](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/coalwalk-row.md), though it leans precariously close to the edge of [Gutterbrew Alley](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/gutterbrew-alley.md). It’s less a shop and more a glorified workshop crammed with forgotten mechanisms, stacks of parchment, and the pungent aroma of ink and oil. Officially a purveyor of “precision components and written records,” the establishment is known throughout [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md) for its peculiar stock and the enigmatic proprietor, a gnome named Fizzwick Sprocketwhirr.

While ostensibly a place to acquire gears, springs, and transcribed documents, the Crooked Cog & Quill quietly caters to a more discerning clientele: adventurers, researchers, and those seeking information that isn’s readily available. Whispers claim Fizzwick has a knack for locating rare components and a network of informants that stretches across the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md).

## History & Proprietor

Fizzwick Sprocketwhirr arrived in [City of Or] some thirty years ago, a refugee from a forgotten gnomish enclave lost to the shifting tunnels beneath the Asara Plate. He’s a tinkerer of considerable skill, capable of repairing nearly any mechanical device and possessing a deep understanding of dwarven engineering principles - gleaned, some say, from forgotten scrolls recovered during his travels.  He rarely speaks about his past, and when he does, his stories are vague and contradictory, often punctuated by sudden shifts in topic. It’s widely believed he’s hiding something – possibly connected to the disappearance of miners near the [Heartforge](/generated/forge/heartforge.md).

## Inventory & Services

* **Mechanical Components:** Gears (common and rare), springs, levers, pistons, clockwork mechanisms, and salvaged parts from forgotten automatons.  Fizzwick often specializes in non-standard sizes and materials, catering to unconventional projects.
* **Written Records:** Transcriptions of ancient dwarven texts (though their accuracy is questionable), maps (some of questionable authenticity), journals detailing forgotten expeditions, and blank parchment of varying quality.
* **Repair Services:** Fizzwick provides expert repairs on clockwork devices, automatons, and other mechanical contraptions. Be warned: his methods are unorthodox, and success is not guaranteed.
* **Information Brokering (Discreetly):**  Fizzwick will gather information for a price. The quality of the information is dependent on the payment offered, and there's no guarantee he won’t share the request with rivals. Rumors suggest he’s been commissioned to investigate the vanishing miners, though he vehemently denies it.

## Notable Quirks

* **Talking Clocks:** The shop is littered with ticking clocks, many of which chime and chime at random intervals. Fizzwick insists they're all perfectly synchronized.
* **Pet Automaton:** A small, brass automaton named ‘Clatter’ scurries about the shop, performing menial tasks and occasionally eavesdropping on customers.
* **Hidden Compartments:** It’s rumored that the shop contains a network of hidden compartments and secret passages – though Fizzwick denies their existence.
* **Fizzwick’s “Special Blend”:** A perpetually brewing pot of dubious tea, said to enhance mechanical aptitude (results vary widely).
