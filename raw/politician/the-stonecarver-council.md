# The Stonecarver Council

## A Tradition of Artisan Governance

Within the sprawling [city of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md), alongside the established Council of Flatstones, exists a lesser-known but equally influential body known as the Stonecarver Council. Originating centuries ago as a guild of master stonemasons, the Council evolved beyond purely artisanal concerns and began advising on urban planning, infrastructure projects, and the preservation of Or's unique subterranean architecture. While the Council of Flatstones manages the city’s overall finances and legal framework, the Stonecarver Council provides expertise on the very foundations upon which Or is built, both literally and figuratively.

## Council Membership & Selection

Unlike the election process for the Council of Flatstones, membership within the Stonecarver Council is neither elected nor hereditary. Instead, individuals are inducted based on demonstrated mastery of stonecraft, architectural knowledge, and a proven commitment to Or's structural integrity. Potential members are nominated by their peers and subjected to rigorous assessments involving complex engineering challenges and historical preservation simulations. The final decision rests with the current Council, a testament to the value placed on experience and judgment within their ranks.

Becoming a Stonecarver Councilor is a profound commitment. Members forgo independent commission work and dedicate themselves fully to the Council's duties, which include: 

*   **Structural Oversight:** Regularly inspecting the city’s tunnels, chambers, and supporting structures for signs of weakness or degradation.
*   **Architectural Guidance:** Reviewing all proposed building plans and urban expansion projects, ensuring alignment with Or’s established aesthetic and structural principles.
*   **Historical Preservation:** Leading efforts to preserve Or’s ancient stonework, including the intricate carvings and inscriptions found throughout the city.
*   **Emergency Response:** In the event of collapses or structural failures, the Council directs the city's emergency response teams and assesses long-term repair strategies.

## Influence and Collaboration

Although possessing less direct political power compared to the Council of Flatstones, the Stonecarver Council wields considerable influence through its specialized knowledge and unwavering dedication to Or’s safety. They frequently collaborate with the Flatstone Council on matters pertaining to urban development, infrastructure upgrades, and the allocation of resources for structural maintenance. The two councils often find themselves at odds, particularly when ambitious development plans threaten to compromise the city’s structural integrity. 

## Distinctive Traditions

The Stonecarver Council adheres to several unique traditions, reflective of their artisan heritage. Council meetings are held within the Great Carving Chamber, a massive subterranean hall adorned with intricate stonework. Members communicate using a formalized language of gestures and hand signals, developed over centuries to convey complex technical concepts swiftly and discreetly. Furthermore, all major Council decisions are symbolically carved into a large stone tablet, known as the “Stone of Concord,” serving as a permanent record of their deliberations and actions.

## Noted Councilors
