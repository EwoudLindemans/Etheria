# Elara Stonehand - Runesmith & Council Diplomat

## Background & Lineage

Elara Stonehand is a rising star in the [Council of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/council-of-or.md), representing the elected seats and known for her sharp wit and even sharper understanding of dwarven runes. Born to a lesser branch of the Stonehand clan – renowned for their expertise in crafting and inscribing magical runes – Elara defied expectations from a young age. Instead of focusing solely on crafting weaponry and armor, she dedicated herself to deciphering ancient runic texts and exploring their historical and societal implications. This pursuit led her to discover connections between forgotten dwarven traditions, the city's founding, and the intricate network of magical conduits woven beneath Or.

Her family initially discouraged this intellectual path, pushing her toward the traditional crafts. However, Elara's extraordinary talent for understanding and manipulating runic energy proved undeniable. She quickly surpassed even the most experienced rune crafters, able to imbue objects with enchantments and wards that were both powerful and elegantly subtle. Her skills caught the eye of several Council members, who recognized her potential as a diplomat and negotiator—a role where her understanding of ancient agreements and runic contracts proved invaluable.

Elara is a striking dwarf, standing slightly taller than average for her kind, with closely cropped, steel-grey hair streaked with silver. Her eyes are a piercing blue, constantly assessing and analyzing her surroundings. She favors practical, well-made clothing in muted tones – deep blues and greys – adorned with subtle, hand-carved runes that serve both as personal wards and displays of her craft.  She carries a meticulously crafted hammer, not for forging, but for tapping and analyzing the stone walls of the city, constantly seeking traces of ancient runes and magical conduits. 

While possessing a naturally serious demeanor, Elara has a dry and sardonic wit that she uses to disarm opponents and navigate tricky negotiations.  She is fiercely independent and holds herself to incredibly high standards, often pushing herself relentlessly to improve her skills and knowledge. Though reserved, she is deeply loyal to those she deems worthy of her trust and will not hesitate to defend her beliefs, even when facing powerful opposition.
