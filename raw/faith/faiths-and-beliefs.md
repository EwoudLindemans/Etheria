# Faiths and Beliefs of Iridia

The people of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) express their connection to the world and the mysteries of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) through a diverse range of faiths and beliefs. While the immediate [manifestations](/structure/chronological/event/manifestation.md) of the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) often inspire awe and reverence, deeper spiritual interpretations and philosophies have arisen from the understanding – or lack thereof – of their true nature and origin.

## The Echoists

Perhaps the most widespread belief system, the Echoists center around the idea that the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) are resonant fragments of a shattered primordial entity – referred to simply as ‘The Source’. They believe that every living thing – every mountain, every river, and every scale – holds an echo of The Source's song. Through meditation, ritual, and the creation of intricate resonant art forms, Echoists strive to harmonize with these echoes, seeking enlightenment and drawing power from the interconnected web of existence. Different schools of Echoism emphasize different aspects of the song – some focus on the chaotic, vibrant notes that represent creation, while others seek the calming, stabilizing tones associated with preservation. The most skilled Echoists can even manipulate these [resonances](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) to heal, fortify, or subtly influence their surroundings.

## The Scale-Bound

A more austere and pragmatic faith, the [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-Bound hold that the scales are [manifestations](/structure/chronological/event/manifestation.md) of a force beyond mortal comprehension, a raw and untamable power that must be respected and carefully controlled. They see the scales not as fragments of a lost being, but as conduits of this power, accessible to those with the discipline and knowledge to harness it. Scale-Bound individuals undergo rigorous training, focusing on understanding the unique properties of each scale and developing techniques to channel its energy without being consumed by it. They are often employed as wardens, protectors, and engineers, safeguarding the vital infrastructure built around the scales and ensuring their safe utilization. The Scale-Bound view the Echoists with a degree of caution, believing their focus on abstract [resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) distracts from the practical realities of harnessing and protecting the scales’ power.

## The Whispers of the Dense

Emerging from the regions bordering the inexplicable fissures leading to [The Dense](/generated/the-dense/the-dense.md), this secretive faith believes the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) are not earthly phenomena at all, but fragments of a forgotten dimension leaking into [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md). They claim to hear whispers emanating from the scales - fragmented messages and prophecies from this otherworldly realm. The followers of the Whispers of [the Dense](/geography/realm/the-dense.md) attempt to decipher these messages, believing they hold the key to understanding Iridia’s destiny and potentially opening a permanent passage to The Dense – a place they both fear and desire.

## Animistic Traditions

In more isolated rural communities, particularly those reliant on specific [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) for their livelihoods, animistic beliefs persist. These traditions view each scale as possessing a spirit or guardian, requiring respect and appeasement through rituals and offerings. Different scales are associated with different aspects of nature – rainfall, harvests, protection from beasts, etc. While many rural communities also subscribe to other more widespread faiths, they maintain their unique animistic practices to ensure the continued favour of the local scale spirits.

## The Convergence

A relatively new philosophical movement gaining traction in urban centers, The Convergence suggests that all faiths and beliefs concerning the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) are merely different perspectives on the same underlying truth. They propose that Echoism, the Scale-Bound practices, the Whispers of [the Dense](/generated/the-dense/the-dense.md), and animistic traditions are all valid paths to understanding the scales and their connection to the wider universe. The Convergence advocates for interfaith dialogue and cooperation, believing that a unified approach is essential to unlocking the scales' full potential and addressing the challenges facing [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md).

## Challenges to Faith

Recent discoveries – and the [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md)’ relentless pursuit of [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) exploitation – have cast a shadow of doubt over existing belief systems. The ability to artificially create scale fragments – however rudimentary – challenges the notion of their divine origin. Furthermore, the unpredictable and sometimes destructive power unleashed by the Arcane Fangs raises questions about the inherent goodness of the scales and the wisdom of those who seek to control them.
