# Healing Practices Across Iridia

[Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md)'s diverse cultures and unique magical landscape have fostered a wide range of healing practices. While traditional herbalism and rudimentary surgery exist, the presence of the magical [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) and the lingering echoes of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)’s power have profoundly shaped how injuries and illnesses are treated. The scarcity of true healers and the inherent dangers of manipulating [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) surrounding the Scales mean that every remedy comes with its own risks and rewards.

## Traditional Remedies & Herbalism

Across [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md), particularly in smaller, isolated settlements, herbalism remains the most common form of healing. Knowledge of local flora and fauna is passed down through generations, with families often possessing secret recipes for poultices, tinctures, and salves. While effective for minor ailments and injuries, these remedies are often powerless against more serious conditions or magical afflictions. Notable herbs include:

*   **Sunbloom:** A vibrant yellow flower found in the [Triz Valley](/geography/settlement/city/triz-valley.md). Its petals are used to create a poultice that accelerates wound healing and reduces inflammation.
*   **Shadowroot:** A hardy root that grows deep within the mountains. Ground and mixed with water, it is used to combat infections, though overuse can lead to vivid nightmares.
*   **[Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) Moss:** A bioluminescent moss found near the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md). It emits a faint, soothing light and is believed to possess mild restorative properties.

## Scale-Infused Healing

The most potent (and dangerous) healing methods involve the manipulation of the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md)’ magical [resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md). Trained “Scale Weavers” are rare and highly sought-after. They can draw upon the energy within the Scales to mend broken bones, cure diseases, and even restore lost limbs. However, this process is far from perfect:

*   **[Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) Sickness:** Prolonged exposure to [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) energy can lead to [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Sickness, a debilitating condition characterized by disorientation, memory loss, and unpredictable magical surges.
*   **Magical Bleed:** Incorrectly channeled energy can cause a “Magical Bleed,” a phenomenon where the patient’s own [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) is destabilized, leading to unpredictable and potentially harmful consequences.
*   **[Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) Dependency:** Frequent Scale-infused healing can lead to a form of dependency, weakening the patient's natural resilience and making them more susceptible to illness.

Different [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) offer unique healing properties. The [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md)’s reflective energies are used to treat eye ailments, while the [Umperas Hull](/geography/scale/umperas-hull.md) is prized for its ability to mend complex fractures. The [Ornite Ring](/geography/scale/ornite-ring.md), though primarily a source of religious significance, is theorized to contain residual healing energies accessible through extremely complex rituals, though these rituals are forbidden by most religions due to their inherently unstable nature.

## Specialized Institutions

Large cities like [Arkona](/generated/city/arkona.md) boast more advanced healing institutions:

*   **The Sunstone Infirmary ([Arkona](/generated/city/arkona.md)):** A renowned establishment employing both traditional healers and trained [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) Weavers. The Infirmary's reputation attracts patients from across [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md), but its high prices make it inaccessible to most.
*   **The Grey Wardens' Clinic (Momentus Outpost):** Primarily focused on treating injuries sustained by adventurers and mercenaries. They utilize a pragmatic approach, prioritizing quick recovery over long-term effects.

## The Cult of Dy and its unorthodox Healing

The [Cult of Dy](/structure/society/factions/cult-of-dy.md) occasionally practices their own forms of healing within their secluded settlements, often combining traditional rituals with the casting of random dice to determine the precise application of their remedies. While considered unorthodox and highly unpredictable, some of their practices have been observed to yield surprising results, attributed to nothing more than sheer luck.
