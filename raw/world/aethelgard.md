# Aethelgard: The Sunken Realm & the Echoing Sky

Aethelgard exists within a paradoxical state – a realm partially submerged beneath a colossal, eternal twilight ocean, and perpetually shadowed by a fractured, echoing sky. Generations ago, a cataclysmic event known as the Great Sundering shattered the original celestial sphere, pulling fragments of it downwards and twisting reality. These fragments, the 'Sky Shards,' orbit Aethelgard, creating a disorienting tapestry of mirrored landscapes and bizarre gravitational anomalies.

## History & The Sundering

The pre-Sundering era is shrouded in myth. Legends speak of a unified empire, the Solarian Dominion, built on advanced geomancy and harnessed solar energies.  They believed they could control the flow of *Aetherium*, the lifeblood of the world, and even shape the very sky. Their hubris, it’s said, led to the Great Sundering.  The exact cause remains debated – some claim reckless experimentation with Aetherium manipulation, others blame an external force drawn to Aethelgard’s power. Regardless, the result was devastating. Entire cities were swallowed by rising tides, landscapes warped, and the sky fragmented. The Solarian Dominion collapsed, its knowledge scattered and largely lost.

## Geography & The Shifting Waters

Aethelgard's surface is a fractured mosaic of submerged ruins, floating islands composed of bizarre crystalline formations, and resilient coastal settlements clinging to existence. The ocean itself isn't a uniform entity; it shifts constantly, influenced by the Sky Shards.  'Tidal Rifts' – areas where gravity fluctuates wildly – create temporary landmasses and dangerous whirlpools, reshaping the coastline daily.  

*   **The Sunken Coast:** Once the heart of the Solarian Dominion, now a labyrinth of drowned palaces and overgrown ruins, haunted by spectral echoes and strange aquatic creatures.
*   **The Crystal Isles:** A series of islands formed from massive, luminous crystals that float serenely above the ocean, sustained by unknown energy sources. They are coveted for their rare minerals and rumored to hold fragments of lost Solarian knowledge.
*   **The Weeping Trenches:** Deep, underwater canyons filled with phosphorescent flora and home to the elusive Deepkin, an amphibious race descended from the original inhabitants.

## The Echoing Sky & the Sky Shards

The fractured sky isn's merely a visual spectacle; it's a tangible force. Each Sky Shard possesses a unique property, subtly influencing the area beneath it:

*   **Shard of Reflection:** Creates a mirror image of the landscape beneath, making navigation treacherous and blurring the line between reality and illusion. 
*   **Shard of Gravity:** Causes localized gravity fluctuations, creating unpredictable updrafts and areas of near weightlessness. 
*   **Shard of Memory:** A constant ripple of echoing voices and fragmented memories constantly washes over this area. Those who spend too long exposed risk losing themselves to the past.
*   **Shard of Stasis:** The area underneath experiences time at a drastically slower pace, objects and beings age slower than normal.

## Races & Cultures

*   **Humans of the Coast (Veridian):** Hardened survivors who build their settlements on sturdy platforms and are adept at navigating the treacherous tides. They are scavengers, salvagers, and skilled sailors.
*   **The Deepkin:** An amphibious race adapted to the underwater environment. They are secretive and rarely interact with surface dwellers, but are rumored to possess knowledge of the Sunken Coast’s deepest secrets.
*   **The Skyborn (Aetherii):** Descendants of Solarian mages who managed to adapt to the fluctuating gravity and strange energies of the Sky Shards. They live in precarious communities built among the Shards, possessing limited but potent magical abilities.

## Factions & Organizations

*   **The Salvage Guild:** A powerful organization that controls much of the salvage and trade on the surface, fiercely protecting their exclusive rights.
*   **The Keepers of the Light:** A religious order dedicated to restoring the original celestial sphere, believing the Shards are a corruption that must be cleansed.
*   **The Shadow Syndicate:** A clandestine organization engaged in smuggling, espionage, and the exploitation of dangerous artifacts.

## Magic & Aetherium

Aetherium is the foundational energy of Aethelgard. It permeates the world, fueling both natural phenomena and magical abilities. While the Solarians possessed advanced knowledge of Aetherium manipulation, much of this knowledge has been lost. Modern [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) is a more rudimentary art, relying on innate talent and the rediscovery of ancient techniques. Many attempt to harness the Aetherium released from the shattered Sky Shards – a dangerous pursuit with unpredictable consequences.
