# Sorcerers

Sorcerers of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) are individuals who manipulate the inherent magical energies leaking from the fractured [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md), without the need for external implements or traditional spellcasting rituals. They are, in essence, living conduits for raw power, their abilities manifesting through an innate and often unpredictable connection to the fragmented essence of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md).

## Lineage and Manifestation

Unlike mages who learn to channel [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) through study and discipline, sorcerers are born with their abilities. The origins of this birthright remain shrouded in mystery, with theories ranging from ancestral ties to [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md) himself to echoes of the creature’s power lingering within certain bloodlines. There is no single, identifiable 'sorcerer lineage,' however, areas closer to the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) often see an increased prevalence of sorcerers, suggesting a geographical correlation.

Sorcerous powers typically manifest during adolescence, often coinciding with periods of intense emotional stress or physical trauma. This sudden emergence can be overwhelming, leaving young sorcerers struggling to control their abilities. [Manifestations](/structure/chronological/event/manifestation.md) vary wildly; some might discover an affinity for elemental manipulation, while others exhibit unusual healing capabilities, precognition, or the ability to subtly influence the minds of others.  The type of power manifested is believed to be linked to the specific [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) closest to their birthplace and their individual psychological makeup.

## Distinctions from Mages

Sorcerers are often viewed with suspicion and awe by the more traditional mage orders.  While mages meticulously study and control their [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) through formulae and rituals, sorcerers draw upon instinct and emotion.  Their powers are often less precise and more volatile.  A mage might conjure a perfectly formed fireball; a sorcerer might unleash a chaotic burst of energy that affects everything nearby. 

This difference in approach leads to significant practical distinctions. Mages excel at consistent spellcasting, allowing them to perform complex rituals and create intricate magical constructs. Sorcerers, however, are often more adaptable in combat, able to unleash devastating, albeit unpredictable, attacks. They are also far more resilient to magical countermeasures designed to disrupt spellcasting, as their powers originate internally rather than through external formulae.

## The Burden of Resonance

All sorcerers share a peculiar affliction known as '[Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md)'. This is a constant awareness of the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md), a subtle vibration that permeates their senses. The closer a sorcerer is to a Scale, the stronger the [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) becomes. For some, this manifests as a persistent headache or a feeling of unease; for others, it’s a flood of fragmented memories and visions not their own—echoes of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)’s last moments.  

More experienced sorcerers learn to filter and interpret this [Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md), using it to predict the weather, locate sources of magical energy, or even glimpse possible futures. However, prolonged exposure to intense [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) can lead to mental instability, unpredictable outbursts of power, and eventually, a complete loss of self. This is why most sorcerers actively avoid proximity to the larger [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) and carefully manage their exposure to Resonance.

## Societal Perception and Training

Sorcerers face a complex relationship with [Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) society. While their raw power is undeniably valuable, their lack of formal training and potential for uncontrolled outbursts often lead to distrust. Few organizations offer dedicated sorcerer training.  Instead, they often seek guidance from independent mentors, typically older, experienced sorcerers, or the more progressive factions within the mage orders. 

The [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md) actively seek out promising young sorcerers, attempting to exploit their abilities for their own gain. Others find themselves coerced into service by powerful nobles seeking personal protection or a source of magical muscle.  The Sisterhood of Assassination is also known to recruit sorcerers, recognizing their potential for covert operations and eliminating targets with ease.
