# Tunnel Networks of Or

The [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md) isn’t just built *in* the mountains; it is *of* the mountains. And the arteries that keep this subterranean metropolis flowing are its vast, interconnected tunnel networks. Far more than simple passageways, these tunnels form a complex ecosystem, supporting specialized industries, secret societies, and even unique forms of life.

## History & Construction

The earliest tunnels were rough-hewn passages dug by the first miners seeking veins of ore. As Or grew, these haphazard routes were gradually expanded and reinforced, evolving into a sprawling system of arteries. The Flatstone family, renowned for their engineering prowess, oversaw the most significant expansions, incorporating advanced techniques using enchanted stonework and geomancy. Layers of tunnels exist at varying depths and qualities - the 'Old Tunnels' are unstable and prone to collapse, avoided by all but the desperate. ‘Royal Passages’ are impeccably maintained, reinforced with runes, and reserved for official council business. The newest tunnels are often bored using massive, steam-powered drill-worms – leaving behind remarkably smooth and circular walls.

## Specialized Tunnel Sectors

*   **The Veinways:** These primary tunnels are used for the transport of raw materials – ore, gemstones, timber, and even processed goods. Specialized ‘dray-bugs,’ giant beetle-like creatures, are commonly employed to haul carts along the Veinways.  They are known to be stubborn and require careful handling.
*   **The [Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) Channels:** A series of meticulously aligned tunnels that harness the geological vibrations of the mountains. Master geomancers use these Channels to amplify and focus energy for various purposes, from powering the [Heartforge](/generated/forge/heartforge.md) to sending coded messages across vast distances. Entry is restricted and fiercely guarded.
*   **The Whisper Galleries:** A network of narrow, curving tunnels specifically designed to transmit sound with minimal interference. These Galleries are primarily used by the city's intelligence network, the ‘Stone Ears’, allowing them to eavesdrop and relay vital information across Or. Skilled Listeners claim to be able to discern the slightest tremor or vibration echoing through the stone.
*   **The Fungal Gardens:** Deep within the lower levels, beyond the reach of natural sunlight, lie vast, artificially illuminated caverns dedicated to the cultivation of bioluminescent fungi and other subterranean flora. These fungi provide a primary source of light and food for the city, as well as rare alchemical ingredients. The air here is thick with spores, and visitors are required to wear protective respirators.

## Tunnel Hazards & Creatures

The tunnel networks aren’s entirely safe. Cave-ins, sudden flooding, and pockets of noxious gas are constant dangers. More sinister threats include:

*   **Stone Crawlers:** Pale, insectoid creatures adapted to life in the dark, preying on miners and other trespassers. They communicate through a series of clicking sounds and are notoriously difficult to track.
*   **Glow-Worms:** Large, bioluminescent worms that secrete a paralyzing venom. Their luminous bodies are highly sought after by alchemists, but approaching them is perilous.
*   **Tunnel Echoes:** Unexplained phenomena involving distorted sounds and hallucinations within certain tunnels. Some believe they are the remnants of past tragedies, while others suspect a connection to the [Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) Channels.
*   **The Shifters:** Mysterious, humanoid creatures that are rumored to live deep within the uncharted tunnels.  They are said to be able to manipulate stone and shadow, and are fiercely protective of their territory.

## Current Concerns

Recent reports indicate increased instability within the older tunnel systems, prompting the [Council of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/council-of-or.md) to allocate significant resources toward stabilization efforts. The disappearances reported by miners have raised concerns about potential new threats emerging from the depths, and exploratory teams have been dispatched to investigate. Some even whisper that the disturbances are somehow linked to the rumored existence of [Asarazul](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/asarazul.md), believing the gem's [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) is destabilizing the surrounding rock.
