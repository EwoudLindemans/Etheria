# Elara Stonebeard - Voice of the Electors

## Background and Rise

Elara Stonebeard is a relatively new, and surprisingly popular, figure in the [Council of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/council-of-or.md), having secured one of the elected seats just three years ago. Her victory was unexpected; Stonebeard ran on a platform of increased transparency within the Flatstone family’s rule and greater representation for the burgeoning artisan guilds and mining communities, groups traditionally overlooked in favor of the established nobility.  Prior to her political career, Elara was a master gemcutter, renowned for her intricate work and keen eye for quality – a skill that translated surprisingly well to identifying inconsistencies and questionable practices within the Council's dealings.  She is a dwarf of medium height for her clan, with close-cropped grey hair streaked with the stubborn remnants of her youthful copper hue and piercing blue eyes that seem to weigh every word with meticulous care.

This initiative initially faced stiff opposition from some council members who viewed the guilds as unruly and unpredictable.
*   **Transparency Initiative:** Stonebeard’s signature pledge – a series of measures designed to make Council proceedings more open to public scrutiny, including publishing meeting minutes and introducing a citizen feedback forum. This has provoked both acclaim and criticism, with some arguing it undermines the Council's authority and exposes strategic vulnerabilities.

## Relationship with the Flatstone Family

Stonebeard's relationship with the dominant Flatstone family is complex. While she publicly acknowledges their historical importance and immense wealth, she has consistently challenged their decisions and questioned their motives – earning her both allies and enemies within the council. [Karath Flatstone](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/karath-flatstone.md), especially during his supposed absence, has sent veiled messages through intermediaries praising Stonebeard’s dedication to the city, but also subtly warning her to
