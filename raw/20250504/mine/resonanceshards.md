# Resonance Shards

## What are Resonance Shards?

[Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) Shards are crystallized fragments of raw [resonance](/raw/20250504/cataclysm/resonance.md) – solidified [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) of significant events and emotions that linger within the world of [your world name]. They aren't merely geological formations; they are temporal remnants, tiny bubbles of the past frozen in time and place. These shards can be found most commonly within caverns, deep underground, and around locations where traumatic events have occurred, particularly areas impacted by [[the Collapse](/structure/chronological/event/the-collapse.md)] or near lingering [echoes]. They often cluster in veins, sometimes exhibiting vibrant, unnatural colors that shift and shimmer depending on the proximity of other shards or sensitive individuals.

## Formation and Properties

The creation of a [Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) Shard is a complex phenomenon tied directly to [the resonance](/raw/20250501/cataclysm/the-resonance.md) that permeates the world. Major upheavals, violent conflicts, expressions of intense emotion, or any significant shift in the fabric of reality can leave a resonant imprint. If these imprints accumulate in a location with the right geological conditions - typically where concentrations of raw [resonance](/raw/20250504/cataclysm/resonance.md) naturally occur – they can coalesce and crystallize into a shard. 

Each shard holds a fragment of the original event, capable of releasing that [resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) when handled or exposed to specific stimuli such as vocalizations, particular frequencies, or even intense thought. The quality and intensity of [the resonance](/raw/20250501/cataclysm/the-resonance.md) varies wildly, from fleeting whispers of forgotten languages to searing visions of past horrors.  The size of a shard doesn’t necessarily correspond to the magnitude of the original event; a tiny shard could contain a very potent [resonance](/raw/20250504/cataclysm/resonance.md) if the original moment was emotionally charged, while a large shard might hold only a faint echo.

## Uses and Dangers

Knowledge of [Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) Shards has been painstakingly gleaned by the [[Uroxi](/being/species/uroxi.md)] and a secretive order of surface scholars known as the Chronomasters. Their uses are numerous, albeit risky:

*   **[Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) Amplification:** Shards can be used to amplify [resonance](/raw/20250504/cataclysm/resonance.md), boosting the effect of spells or rituals that rely on it. This is a primary focus of Chronomaster research.
*   **Echo Location:** Skilled individuals – particularly those attuned to [resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md), like some [[Uroxi](/being/species/uroxi.md)] Pathfinders – can 'listen' to shards to glean information about past events at the shard’s location. This is however, highly unreliable and prone to distortion.
*   **Memory Storage:**  Certain refined shards can be used to store and replay brief moments of sensory input, acting as a crude form of temporal recording, though the playback is often fragmented and unstable.

However, interacting with [Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) Shards carries significant risks:

*   **[Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) Bleed:** Exposure to too many shards, or shards of particularly volatile [resonances](/raw/20250504/cataclysm/resonance.md), can result in ‘[resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) bleed’ – a debilitating condition where the individual experiences fragmented memories, visions, and emotions from the shards' origins, potentially driving them mad. 
*   **Temporal Distortion:** Improper handling of shards can create localized temporal distortions, causing objects or individuals to briefly phase in and out of time or experience fleeting glimpses of alternate timelines. 
*   **Echo Parasites:** In rare instances, shards can attract parasitic entities composed of pure [resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md), known as 'Echo Parasites.' These entities feed on [the resonance](/raw/20250501/cataclysm/the-resonance.md) within the shard and can lash out at nearby individuals with chaotic temporal energies.
