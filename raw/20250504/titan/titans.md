# Titans: Remnants of a Shattered Age

For millennia, the people of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) have spoken of the [Titans](/raw/20250501/titan/titans.md) - colossal beings of immense power, whose actions shaped the very landscape and whose fall ushered in the current age. Once, these beings walked the land alongside the progenitors of all races, serving as both guardians and, occasionally, tyrannical overlords. Their existence is shrouded in myth and fragmented records, yet the scars of their dominion remain visible across the continent.

## Origins and Nature

Legend states that the [Titans](/raw/20250501/titan/titans.md) were not born, but *manifested* – coalescing from the raw magical energy that permeated [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) before the rise of sentient life. Each Titan embodied a specific aspect of this energy: strength, creation, destruction, foresight, and change. Their physical forms varied wildly, reflecting their elemental domains. Some were mountains made flesh, others swirling vortexes of magical force contained within a semblance of a body.  They possessed a sentience unlike anything currently known – a vast, alien intellect detached from the concerns of mortals. Scholars theorize that the Titans predated even the concept of divinity; they were the *source* of the power that now fuels the gods.

## The Sundering & Their Legacy

The age of the [Titans](/raw/20250501/titan/titans.md) ended abruptly with what is now known as the Sundering. Accounts differ, but the most widely accepted theory posits that internal conflict arose amongst the Titans.  Arguments over dwindling magical reserves and differing philosophies regarding the emerging races ultimately escalated into a cataclysmic war that ripped apart the fabric of reality.  The resulting energy backlash shattered the Titans, scattering their fragments across [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) and beyond. Some fragments simply ceased to exist, while others – known as Titan Shards – retained a portion of their original power, becoming potent sources of both [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and peril.

## Titan Shards

These remnants of the [Titans](/raw/20250501/titan/titans.md) are highly sought after by [mages](/raw/20250504/mage/mages.md), artificers, and power-hungry individuals. They appear in a multitude of forms:

*   **Crystalline Formations:** Often found within deep caves or ancient ruins, these shards resonate with immense magical power, capable of amplifying spells or powering complex artifacts.
*   **Living Shards:**  Occasionally, a shard will 'awaken,' forming a miniature, often monstrous, creature exhibiting fragments of the original [Titan’s](/raw/20250501/titan/titans.md) traits. These beings are typically unpredictable and hostile.
*   **[Echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md):** Rare and elusive, Echoes are psychic imprints left by the [Titans](/raw/20250501/titan/titans.md)’ thoughts and memories.  Communicating with an Echo is incredibly dangerous, as it risks madness or possession.

## The Titan's Influence on Races and Locations

*   **Dwarves of Mount Stonefist:** Legends claim the Dwarves' mastery of stone and metal is a direct result of proximity to a massive Titan Shard buried deep within the mountain. They guard this Shard with fanatical zeal.
*   **The [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md)’ obsession with Titan Shards:** The ruthless Arcane Fangs view Titan Shards as the key to unlocking ultimate power, believing that by fusing them with magical creatures or even themselves, they can ascend to a state of near-godhood.
*   **The [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md)’s crystalline formations:** The unique reflective properties of the Asara Plate’s crystals are attributed to the presence of microscopic Titan Shards embedded within its structure. 

## Recent Discoveries

Recent expeditions into [The Dense](/geography/realm/the-dense.md) have yielded disturbing reports of colossal, dormant structures radiating immense magical energy. Some scholars believe these may be the remnants of Titan bodies, slowly reawakening after millennia of slumber, posing a significant threat to the stability of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md).
