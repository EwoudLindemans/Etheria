# The Stonebound Tribes

The lands surrounding the larger [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) formations are often claimed by hardy, nomadic tribes known as the Stonebound. These people live a life inextricably linked to the Scales, drawing sustenance, shelter, and cultural significance from these colossal remnants of a forgotten age. Unlike the sprawling cities that have arisen around some Scales, the Stonebound maintain a decentralized, tribal structure, moving with the seasons and following the migratory patterns of certain hardy fauna attracted to the residual magical energies.

## Origins and Beliefs

Legend claims the Stonebound are descendants of those who first witnessed the fall of the ancient beings that created the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md). These individuals, rather than fleeing, attempted to commune with the falling entities, hoping to understand their nature and harness their power. While they failed to control the power, their connection to the land and the Scales deepened, imbuing them with a resilience and a strange connection to stone and earth. Their shamanistic [culture](/raw/20250501/dwarf/culture.md) revolves around interpreting the “whispers of the Stone,” believing the Scales themselves are sentient, albeit slumbering, beings.

## Tribe Structure and Customs

Stonebound society is fundamentally matriarchal. Each tribe is led by a 'Stone Mother', an elder woman known for her ability to interpret the Stone’s whispers and guide the tribe’s movements. Younger women are trained as ‘Stone Shapers’ – individuals who can manipulate small amounts of stone and earth using inherent magical abilities, often used for building temporary shelters, finding water sources, or creating simple tools. Men are primarily responsible for hunting, scouting, and protecting the tribe from threats, both natural and from other tribes.

Key customs include:

*   **The Stone-Marking Ceremony:** Upon reaching adulthood, each Stonebound individual undergoes a ritual where a small piece of [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-stone is imprinted onto their skin, signifying their connection to the Stone and granting them a minor blessing related to their aptitude (strength, speed, healing, etc.).
*   **Seasonal Migrations:** Tribes typically follow predictable routes dictated by the availability of resources and the influence of specific [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md). Certain Scales are believed to grant boons to crops or attract migratory beasts during particular seasons.
*   **The Silence Pact:** When approaching a new [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) or encountering another tribe, the Stonebound observe a period of 'The Silence Pact,' refraining from unnecessary noise or speech to avoid disturbing the slumbering Stone and maintain respectful boundaries.

## Known Stonebound Tribes

*   **The Shale Walkers:** Masters of navigating treacherous rocky terrain, known for their expertise in hunting the hardy Cliff Strider beasts.
*   **The Emberkin:** A tribe dwelling near the [Umperas Hull](/geography/scale/umperas-hull.md), known for their resilience to heat and their ability to extract trace amounts of geothermal energy from the cracked [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md).
*   **The Whisperers of the Asara:** Claiming lineage to the original Stone-Witnesses, these reclusive individuals seek to interpret the deepest mysteries of the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md), often disappearing for years at a time into the shadows of the [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md).

## Conflict and Relations

While generally peaceful, Stonebound tribes occasionally clash over access to scarce resources or disputed hunting grounds. The [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md) frequently attempt to infiltrate Stonebound communities, attempting to exploit their knowledge of [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) locations and [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md).  The Sisterhood of Assassination has been known to target Stone Mothers, attempting to destabilize the tribes and disrupt their traditions.
