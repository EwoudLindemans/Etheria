# Scalebound Rot

The Scalebound Rot is not a traditional [undead](/raw/20250501/undead/undead.md) plague, but a horrific consequence of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md)'s corrupted [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) and decaying [resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md). Unlike mindless flesh-eaters, these creatures are twisted reflections of their former selves, animated and controlled by the lingering [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) of [scale-resonance](/raw/20250501/transformation/scale-resonance.md) and driven by a desperate, echoing longing for integration.

## Origins and Transmission

The first cases of Scalebound Rot emerged in areas heavily scarred by [Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) Anchors – particularly those sites where Anchor activations caused severe [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) fracturing and leakage. It's theorized that the lingering [resonance](/raw/20250504/cataclysm/resonance.md), rather than animating corpses directly, instead attaches itself to weakened beings (often those already suffering from some form of [resonance sickness](/raw/20250501/condition/resonance-sickness.md)) and grafts scale fragments onto their bodies. This process isn't instant; it's a slow, agonizing transformation, marked by increasing scale growth, memory fragmentation, and a blurring of identity.

Transmission occurs through direct physical contact with [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) fragments or fluids from afflicted individuals. The process isn't always immediately contagious; exposure creates a “[resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) seed” that requires a period of vulnerability—often linked to [resonance](/raw/20250504/cataclysm/resonance.md) fluctuations—to fully germinate. The intensity of exposure directly influences the speed and severity of the infection.

## Physical Characteristics and Behavior

Scalebound Rot victims exhibit a range of appearances, depending on the type of [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) they’ve absorbed. Commonly, their bodies are increasingly covered in mismatched, jagged scale growths, often in patterns mimicking the original scale’s structure, but warped and distorted. Muscle tissue is gradually replaced by scale, rendering movement jerky and unpredictable. 

Unlike typical [undead](/raw/20250501/undead/undead.md), they don’t crave flesh for sustenance. Instead, they exhibit a compulsion to
