# Scalecrawlers

## Appearance and Biology

Scalecrawlers are a unique species of subterranean predator, heavily reliant on the ambient magical energy that permeates [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md), particularly that emanating from the great [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md). They are vaguely reptilian in form, resembling a cross between a pangolin and a giant centipede, though they are neither entirely insect nor reptile. Their bodies are entirely covered in overlapping plates of iridescent chitin that shimmer with a faint, internal light – these plates are formed from a unique process where they passively absorb and crystallize ambient magical energy, essentially becoming living conduits.

The average Scalecrawler reaches lengths of 6 to 10 feet, though larger individuals, especially those inhabiting areas near particularly potent [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md), can exceed 15 feet. Their legs are short and powerful, ending in sharp claws adapted for digging and clinging to uneven terrain. They have no visible eyes, navigating and hunting using an incredibly sensitive network of vibration-detecting hairs covering their bodies and a rudimentary form of echolocation that involves emitting pulses of low-frequency magical energy.

Scalecrawlers exhibit a bizarre form of symbiotic relationship with the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) themselves. They instinctively seek out areas near these massive geological formations, and while they do not actively *feed* on the scales' energy, their presence seems to strengthen the scales’ magical aura, and in turn, the scales amplify their sensory abilities and grant them a measure of protection from magical interference.

## Behavior and Habitat

These creatures are primarily nocturnal and solitary, emerging from their deep subterranean tunnels to hunt under the cover of darkness. They are ambush predators, remaining motionless for extended periods, perfectly blending with the surrounding environment thanks to their shimmering [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md). Their primary prey consists of giant cave insects, subterranean rodents, and occasionally, unsuspecting travelers who stray too far from established paths.

Scalecrawlers are highly territorial, and clashes between individuals are rare but brutal, often resulting in serious injury or death. When threatened, they can curl their bodies into a near-impenetrable ball, further reinforced by their hardened chitinous plates, making them exceptionally difficult to harm.

Scalecrawlers are most commonly found beneath the larger [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) – the [Umperas Hull](/geography/scale/umperas-hull.md), [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md), and Ornith Ring being particularly well-populated. They burrow deep into the earth, creating intricate networks of tunnels and chambers which they use as nesting and hunting grounds.

## Connection to Arcane Fangs and Cult of Dy

The [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md) are particularly interested in Scalecrawlers due to their ability to passively absorb and crystallize [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md). They have developed crude methods of extracting and refining the crystallized energy from Scalecrawler [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md), using it to power their arcane devices and enhance their own magical abilities. This practice, however, is incredibly dangerous, as forcefully removing the scales destabilizes the creatures and can lead to unpredictable magical outbursts.

The [Cult of Dy](/structure/society/factions/cult-of-dy.md) views Scalecrawlers as embodiments of random chance – their shimmering [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) representing the capricious nature of the three deities. Some members of the Cult have attempted to use Scalecrawlers in their Fire Trials, believing their unpredictable behaviour to be a reflection of Dy’s influence. These experiments, predictably, have resulted in chaos and destruction.
