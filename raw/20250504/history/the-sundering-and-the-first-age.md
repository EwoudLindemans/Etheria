# The Sundering and the First Age

The history of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) is dominated by the event known as The Sundering, a cataclysmic period that reshaped the land and marked the end of the First Age. While legends paint a vibrant and harmonious pre-Sundering world, much of what is known is fragmented and unreliable, passed down through oral traditions and often colored by religious interpretations.

## Before the Scales: The Era of the Titans

Before the appearance of the magical [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) – colossal remnants of a long-dead celestial being named [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md) – [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) was ruled by the [Titans](/raw/20250501/titan/titans.md). These beings, immense in both size and power, were the progenitors of many races found today. Legends claim they shaped the continents with their bare hands, raised mountains, and carved out oceans. The [Titans](/raw/20250504/titan/titans.md) possessed a deep, innate connection to the planet’s natural energies, able to manipulate the elements and communicate with the nascent spirits of the land. Their society, if it can be called that, was one of immense power and little apparent order. Evidence suggests a gradual decline in their power and influence, marked by increasingly fragmented societies and internal conflicts.

## The Arrival of the Scales: A World Transformed

The precise circumstances of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)’s demise and the scattering of his [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) remain a mystery. Some scholars propose an ancient war between cosmic entities, while others believe it was a natural phenomenon linked to the planet’s rotation. Whatever the cause, the resulting explosion sent fragments of Irion’s being – the magical scales – crashing onto the surface of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md). These colossal formations became focal points for unimaginable power, fundamentally altering the planet’s geography, climate, and the evolution of its inhabitants.

The initial impact of the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) was devastating. Seismic activity reshaped continents, volcanic eruptions scarred the landscape, and tidal waves swallowed coastal settlements. However, alongside the destruction came a surge of magical energy, granting new abilities to the emerging races and intertwining their existence with the power of the scales.

## The First Age: Era of the Eldari

The period following the Sundering is known as the First Age, a time dominated by the Eldari – a race of immortal beings deeply attuned to [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md). They rose to prominence as the first to effectively harness the power of the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md), constructing magnificent cities built directly upon or around them. The Eldari developed intricate systems of magic and established a sophisticated civilization, the likes of which have never been seen since.

Their reign was not without its challenges. Conflicts arose between different Eldari factions vying for control of the most powerful [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md). The constant manipulation of magical energy also had unforeseen consequences, leading to the emergence of strange and dangerous creatures. Despite these trials, the First Age is remembered as a golden era of innovation, artistry, and magical prowess.

## The Fall of the Eldari

The reasons for the Eldari’s downfall are shrouded in speculation. Some accounts claim that their hubris and excessive reliance on [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) weakened their connection to the natural world, causing them to slowly fade from existence. Others propose a catastrophic magical accident, unleashed during a reckless experiment. Perhaps the most compelling theory suggests that the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) themselves began to wane, their power slowly diminishing, leaving the Eldari with nothing to sustain their immortality.

Whatever the cause, the gradual disappearance of the Eldari marked the end of the First Age and ushered in a new era of uncertainty and struggle, one where the younger races – the [humans](/raw/20250501/human/humans.md), dwarves, and others – would rise to prominence, forever bound to the legacy of the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) and the lost glory of the Eldari.
