# Lyra Stonehand

Lyra Stonehand is a renowned artificer and historian hailing from the [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md), famed for her intricate clockwork mechanisms and tireless pursuit of forgotten lore pertaining to the Great Unbinding – the cataclysmic event that created the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md).

## Background

Born into a long line of dwarven artisans, Lyra displayed an uncanny aptitude for mechanics from a young age. While her family specialized in traditional stoneworking, Lyra found herself drawn to the complexities of gears, springs, and automatons. Her restless curiosity often led her into the forbidden archives beneath the city, where she devoured ancient texts detailing the Unbinding and the legendary beings who shaped [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md).

Lyra's research led her to a controversial theory: the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) are not merely inert geological formations, but fragmented [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) of a colossal, sentient creature – [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md). She believes that understanding the Scales’ inner workings and harnessing their energy could unlock unprecedented technological advancements, but also risk unleashing unpredictable and potentially disastrous consequences. 

## Appearance

Lyra is a relatively short, stocky dwarf with a determined gaze and calloused hands stained with oil and metallic dust. Her dark hair is pulled back into a practical braid adorned with small, intricately carved gears. She typically wears sturdy leather trousers, a reinforced tunic, and a multitude of pockets and pouches filled with tools, components, and sketches. A pair of intricate goggles, equipped with magnification lenses and various measuring devices, constantly rests upon her forehead.

## Personality

Lyra is a driven and fiercely independent woman. Her dedication to her research often consumes her, causing her to neglect her personal life and appear aloof or eccentric to others. While she can be brusque and impatient, she possesses a dry wit and a surprising amount of empathy. She deeply values knowledge and intellectual discourse, and is always eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals – provided they can keep up with her relentless pace.

## Skills & Equipment

*   **Master Artificer:** Lyra can design, construct, and repair incredibly complex mechanical devices. Her specialty lies in clockwork automatons, precision instruments, and energy harnessing systems.
*   **Historical Scholar:**  Her knowledge of [Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) history, particularly the events surrounding the Unbinding and the legends of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md), is unparalleled.
*   **Runic Inscription:** Lyra is proficient in the ancient art of runic inscription, which she uses to imbue her creations with magical properties.
*   **Equipment:**
    *   **The Chronometer:** A highly precise clockwork device capable of measuring temporal distortions and fluctuations - a key tool for her research into the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md).
    *   **Automaton Companion - 'Cogsworth':**  A small, nimble automaton designed for scouting, retrieving components, and assisting in delicate tasks.
    *   **Runestone Engraver:** A specialized tool for meticulously etching runes onto various materials.
    *   **Various tools, components, and a satchel filled with schematics and notes**

## Current Goals

*   Decipher ancient runes found on the [Umperas Hull](/geography/scale/umperas-hull.md), believed to contain a map to a hidden chamber within the [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md).
*   Develop a prototype device capable of extracting and storing energy from the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md), while mitigating potential instability.
*   Gain access to restricted archives within the Flatstone dynasty's vaults, hoping to uncover lost documents pertaining to [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)'s demise.
