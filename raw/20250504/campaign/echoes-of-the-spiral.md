# Echoes of the Spiral: A Mohinders Campaign

## Campaign Overview

*[Echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) of the Spiral* is a mid-level campaign (levels 6-10) set within the fractured city of [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md). The premise revolves around a resurgence of ancient, spiral-shaped portals—dormant artifacts from a forgotten civilization that predates even the Elf’s arrival in the Spiral. These portals are appearing sporadically throughout Mohinders, emitting strange energies and drawing the attention of both the Council and the Veilbreakers. However, they aren't merely gateways; they seem to be resonating with a forgotten consciousness, whispering fragmented memories and prophecies to those sensitive enough to hear them.

The player characters find themselves caught between these factions, tasked with uncovering the origins of the spiral portals and preventing their manipulation by those seeking to exploit their power. The campaign explores themes of memory, identity, and the dangers of unchecked ambition, ultimately questioning the very foundations of [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md) and the Spiral itself.
