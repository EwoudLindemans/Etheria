# Scale-Scourge: The Walking Resonants

The term 'zombie' holds little meaning in [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md). Necromancy, as practiced by the Veiled Canticle, is a tightly controlled and ritualistic affair. However, the fractured [resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) of the world has birthed something far more horrifying: the [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-Scourge, colloquially known as the “Walking Resonants”. They are not raised through dark [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), but are victims of a far more insidious corruption – the residue of shattered scales and warped [resonance](/raw/20250504/cataclysm/resonance.md).

## Origins: Resonance Bleed

Following the Shattered Chorus events, regions saturated with unstable [resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) – particularly around damaged [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) or areas heavily scarred by [Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) conflicts – began exhibiting a peculiar phenomenon. The dead, or those critically wounded, would not remain so. Instead, they would stir, their bodies animated by a fragmented echo of the scale’s power. This '[resonance](/raw/20250504/cataclysm/resonance.md) bleed' disrupts the natural cycle of decay, forcing the individual into a state of perpetual, agonizing reanimation. It’s a slow process, initially manifesting as tremors and involuntary spasms before culminating in a shambling, uncoordinated existence.

## Appearance & Behavior

[Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-Scourge appearances are as varied as the scales that corrupt them.  Some are little more than desiccated husks, partially fused with fragments of shattered [resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) crystals, moving with agonizing slowness. Others are bloated and grotesque, pulsating with internal [resonance](/raw/20250504/cataclysm/resonance.md) fluctuations, their bodies contorted by the incomplete restoration of life.  A key feature is the **resonant shimmer**, a barely perceptible distortion of light around their bodies, indicative of the unstable [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) animating them.

Unlike traditional [undead](/raw/20250501/undead/undead.md), [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-Scourge are driven not by malice or hunger, but by a primal compulsion to seek out and touch further sources of [resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md). They stumble toward broken scales, abandoned [resonance](/raw/20250504/cataclysm/resonance.md) anchors, or even living beings exhibiting strong [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) signatures (such as Irids or those wielding resonant tools). This isn't an act of predation, but a desperate attempt to stabilize their own fractured state – a futile and terrifying pursuit.

## Types of Scale-Scourge

*   **Shard-Scourge:**  Commonly found near shattered red [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md). These are slow, almost glacial in their movement, but incredibly durable, their bodies reinforced by the scale’s inherent resilience. 
*   **[Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md)-Bloat:**  Corrupted by large, unstable blue [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md), these Scourge are grotesquely swollen and prone to unpredictable bursts of uncontrolled [resonance](/raw/20250504/cataclysm/resonance.md), often creating localized distortions of reality.
*   **Echo-Drifters:** Rare variants found near Echo Caves and highly resonant locations. They move with unsettling fluidity and seem to fade in and out of existence, mimicking the echoing [resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) within their surroundings. Often whisper fragmented phrases - [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) of the deceased's memories.

## Combating the Scale-Scourge

Traditional weapons are largely ineffective against the [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-Scourge. Their bodies are often resistant to blunt force and piercing attacks due to the scale's inherent properties. The most effective method is **resonant disruption**. Weapons attuned to specific [resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) frequencies – particularly those counteracting the resonant signature of the scale corrupting the Scourge – can temporarily destabilize their animation, causing them to collapse into inert piles of decaying matter.  However, the Scourge often return after a period of time, particularly in areas saturated with unstable [resonance](/raw/20250504/cataclysm/resonance.md).

The **Veiled Canticle** has developed limited resonant cleansing rituals to contain outbreaks, but these are costly and require skilled practitioners.  The Scalebreakers, unfortunately, often exacerbate the problem by recklessly exploiting resonant sources, inadvertently creating more Scourge in their wake.

## Lore & Rumors

Some scholars theorize that the [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-Scourge are not merely reanimated corpses, but are fragments of the shattered [resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) itself, desperately seeking to reassemble. Others whisper of an
