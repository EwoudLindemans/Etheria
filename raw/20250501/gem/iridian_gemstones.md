# Iridian Gemstones

[Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md)'s magical [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) have had a profound impact not just on the land, but also on the geological composition, most notably the formation of unique [gemstones](/raw/20250504/gem/gemstones.md) known as [Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) Gems. Unlike typical gems, these stones are not born from deep within the earth but are formed in conjunction with the scale's presence, absorbing and refracting the residual [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) flowing from them. Their properties are intrinsically linked to the scale they originate from, imbuing them with fascinating and often unpredictable powers.

## Formation and Varieties

[Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) gems rarely occur naturally outside of areas heavily influenced by a [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md). They primarily form within '[Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) Veins' - narrow fissures that extend outward from a scale's base, carrying concentrated magical energy. The type of gem formed is heavily dependent on the scale’s color and magical signature. The more vibrant and potent a scale is, the more diverse and powerful the gems that can be found within its [resonance](/raw/20250504/cataclysm/resonance.md) veins.

Here’s a breakdown of common [Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) gem varieties, linked to their parent [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md):

*   **Azure [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) (The [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md)):** Yield **Skydrop Gems**. These vibrant blue gems shimmer with an inner light and are renowned for their ability to manipulate light and illusions. Skilled artisans can craft lenses and prisms from Skydrop Gems, creating captivating visual displays.
*   **Golden [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) ([Umperas Hull](/geography/scale/umperas-hull.md)):** Produce **Sunstone Shards**. Possessing a warm, radiant glow, Sunstone Shards are prized for their healing properties, capable of accelerating natural recovery and easing burns. They're often incorporated into medicinal potions and restorative amulets.
*   **Black [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) ([Ornite Ring](/geography/scale/ornite-ring.md)):** Give rise to **Voidstones**. These opaque black gems are the most enigmatic, believed to possess a connection to the void beyond [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md). They are incredibly difficult to work with and are rumored to hold the power to manipulate shadows and drain magical energy, though such claims remain unverified.
*   **Yellow [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) ([Umperas Hull](/geography/scale/umperas-hull.md)):** Yield **Sunstone Fragments**. Similar in properties to their larger Sunstone Shard cousin, these fragments are easier to acquire and commonly used for creating warm lighting in homes or reinforcing basic magical gear.
*   **Green [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) (Hypothetical – Rare):** No Green Scales have been discovered in [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) yet, though scholars theorize they would yield gems with powerful life-giving and growth-enhancing properties, perhaps even capable of accelerating plant life or influencing the weather. The [Cult of Dy](/structure/society/factions/cult-of-dy.md) desperately searches for such a Scale.

## Magical Properties and Uses

Beyond their visual appeal, [Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) gems are highly sought after for their inherent magical properties. They are frequently incorporated into:

*   **Magical Gear:** [Gemstones](/raw/20250504/gem/gemstones.md) can be fused into weapons and armor, granting enhanced magical abilities or resistances. Voidstones, for instance, are rumored to improve resistance to shadow [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), while Skydrop Gems can bolster illusionary powers.
*   **Rituals and Ceremonies:** Specific gem types are used in rituals tied to certain deities or magical practices. The Followers of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md) use carefully arranged Skydrop Gems to focus and amplify their connection to Irion’s residual energy.
*   **Art and Decorative Purposes:** The beauty and magical properties of [Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) Gems have made them a popular choice for jewelry, sculptures, and other art forms.

## Harvesting and Trade

Harvesting [Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) Gems is a dangerous profession. [Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) Veins are often unstable and prone to unpredictable magical surges. Furthermore, the [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md) actively seek to monopolize the trade, making prospecting and extraction a constant risk. Gem markets in cities like [Triz Valley](/geography/settlement/city/triz-valley.md) are bustling centers of commerce, where miners, merchants, and [mages](/raw/20250504/mage/mages.md) converge to buy, sell, and trade these precious resources.
