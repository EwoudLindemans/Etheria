# Aeloria: The Sundered Continent

Aeloria, once a jewel of unity and prosperity, is now a continent fractured by ancient conflict and shrouded in a perpetual twilight. Situated between Xaratius to the west and Meskjor to the east, Aeloria bears the scars of a cataclysmic event known as the Sundering, which reshaped its geography and its people. The continent is characterized by its dramatic landscapes - towering, obsidian peaks, shimmering crystal forests, and vast plains scarred by deep, echoing rifts.  The air itself feels heavy with sorrow and [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) of a forgotten power.

## A History Etched in Stone

Long before the Sundering, Aeloria was a unified kingdom renowned for its mastery of geomancy, the art of shaping the earth's energies. The Aelori, a proud and learned people, cultivated a symbiotic relationship with the land, drawing power from its core.  Their capital city, Aeridor, was a marvel of engineering and natural beauty, built into the side of the Mount Cinderheart – a dormant volcano considered sacred. The kingdom flourished under the guidance of the Geomaster Council, a group of powerful [mages](/raw/20250504/mage/mages.md) dedicated to maintaining the continent's balance.

However, a shadow fell upon Aeloria in the form of the [Kryll](/raw/20250501/species/kryll.md), beings of pure entropy who sought to unravel the natural order. A devastating war erupted, fueled by the Kryll’s dark [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and the Aelori’s desperate attempts to protect their homeland.  The final battle, fought atop Mount Cinderheart, culminated in a reckless act of desperation: a geomantic ritual designed to banish the Kryll. The ritual backfired spectacularly.  Instead of banishing the Kryll, it unleashed an uncontrolled surge of geomantic energy, tearing Aeloria asunder.

The Sundering shattered the continent, creating deep rifts that bisected the land, creating the Broken Expanse. Mount Cinderheart itself was split in two, and the once-continuous landmass was splintered into a scattering of islands and peninsulas. The [Kryll](/raw/20250501/species/kryll.md) vanished in the chaos, leaving behind a continent scarred and broken.

## Regions and Notable Locations

*   **The Broken Expanse:** A vast network of shattered islands and fragmented peninsulas, riddled with dangerous rifts and unpredictable geomantic fluctuations. Navigation here is perilous, and the land itself is unstable.
*   **The Obsidian Peaks:** A jagged chain of volcanic mountains formed from the eruption during the Sundering. Rumored to be home to remnants of the [Kryll](/raw/20250501/species/kryll.md)'s influence and guarded by twisted elemental spirits.  The ruins of older geomantic research facilities can be found here.
*   **The Crystalwood:**  A bizarre forest where the trees have been transformed into immense, iridescent crystals. The Crystalwood emanates a strange, otherworldly energy and is believed to hold the key to understanding the Sundering's true nature. Some believe the crystals contain memories of the events of the Sundering.
*   **The Sunken Ruins of Aeridor:**  Once the proud capital, Aeridor now lies submerged beneath a vast inland sea formed by the Sundering. Divers and treasure hunters brave the dangerous depths, searching for lost artifacts and knowledge.
*   **[The Shifting Sands](/raw/20250501/region/the-shifting-sands.md) of Atheria:** A desert region plagued by geomantic storms and shifting dunes. Nomadic tribes, known as the Sandstriders, eke out a precarious existence, trading in salvaged technology and guiding travelers through the treacherous landscape.

## The People of Aeloria

The Sundering scattered the Aelori people, leaving them fractured and struggling to survive. Several distinct [cultures](/raw/20250501/dwarf/culture.md) have emerged, each adapting to their new environments.

*   **The Riftwalkers:**  A hardy group who have learned to navigate the treacherous Rifts and harness their power. They often serve as guides and messengers.
*   **The Crystalweavers:** A secretive order of [mages](/raw/20250504/mage/mages.md) who study the Crystalwood's energy and attempt to restore the continent's geomantic balance.
*   **The Sandstriders:** Nomadic desert dwellers, skilled survivalists and traders.

## Current State

Aeloria remains a land of sorrow and uncertainty. Small pockets of civilization cling to existence, struggling against the harsh environment and the lingering effects of the Sundering. Whispers of the [Kryll](/raw/20250501/species/kryll.md)’s return circulate, fueling fear and prompting desperate searches for ancient artifacts that might offer protection. The quest to understand the Sundering and potentially restore Aeloria to its former glory consumes many, but the task seems daunting, and hope is a fragile commodity.
