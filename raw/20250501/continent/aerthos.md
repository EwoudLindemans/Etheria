# Aerthos: The Sunken Continent

Aerthos is a continent steeped in mystery and tragedy, a shattered land perpetually shrouded in swirling mists and plagued by unpredictable elemental storms. Once a vibrant center of advanced arcane study and a major trade hub, Aerthos suffered a catastrophic event known only as “The Sundering” centuries ago, resulting in its near-complete submersion beneath the turbulent [Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) Sea. Only the highest peaks and remnants of colossal structures remain above water, creating a treacherous archipelago teeming with dangerous wildlife and remnants of forgotten [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md).  The lingering effects of The Sundering have warped the land and its inhabitants, creating strange anomalies and powerful, unstable magical currents.

Aerthos’s unique position relative to the **[Ornite Ring](/geography/scale/ornite-ring.md)** makes it prone to peculiar phenomena.  The Ring’s fluctuating energy bleeds into the continent, intensifying storms and occasionally causing pockets of displaced time, where [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) of the past momentarily resurface.

## History and The Sundering

Before the calamity, Aerthos was home to the Aetherian Empire, a civilization renowned for their mastery of elemental manipulation and their impressive constructs powered by refined **[scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)** energy.  The Aetherians built towering cities, intricate irrigation systems, and marvels of engineering that harnessed the power of the land. Ancient texts speak of a 'Great [Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md)' – an attempt to channel the energy of the **scales** into a single, continent-spanning network. Whether this was the cause of The Sundering or merely a contributing factor remains a subject of heated debate among scholars.

The prevailing theory suggests that the Aetherian’s ambition outstripped their understanding. The attempt to create the Great [Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) caused an uncontrolled surge of energy that destabilized the land, resulting in a massive earthquake and a sudden rise in sea levels. Coastal cities were swallowed whole, and vast swathes of land were plunged into the depths. Some accounts blame interference from The Unborn, suggesting a deliberate attempt to sabotage the Aetherian’s progress.

## Current State & Inhabitants

Today, Aerthos is a dangerous and largely unexplored region.  Small, isolated settlements cling to the few remaining islands, struggling to survive amidst the harsh conditions and the ever-present threat of the sea. The survivors of The Sundering are a hardy and resilient people, descendants of the Aetherians who adapted to the new reality. They possess a deep knowledge of the sea and the strange currents that surround the continent, and have developed unique techniques for harvesting resources from the ocean.

Aside from the human survivors, Aerthos is home to a variety of mutated creatures and strange, aquatic lifeforms that have evolved in the aftermath of The Sundering. These include colossal, leviathan-like beasts, schools of phosphorescent fish, and monstrous, amphibious predators. There are also rumors of remnants of Aetherian constructs, corrupted by the chaotic energy of the continent, roaming the submerged ruins.

## Points of Interest

*   **The Sunken Library of [Veridian](/raw/20250501/continent/veridian.md):**  Legend tells of a vast library, once the heart of Aetherian knowledge, which remains intact beneath the waves. Rumors persist that powerful artifacts and forbidden knowledge lie within, guarded by ancient automatons and sea monsters. Gorgraths Wrath has dispatched a team to secure any information related to ancient [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) technology.
*   **The Shifting Reefs:** These are dangerous, ever-changing formations of coral and rock that surround the continent. The reefs are home to countless species of aquatic life, but are also riddled with unpredictable currents and hidden dangers. Skilled sailors can navigate the reefs to access secluded coves and submerged ruins. The currents here are believed to be connected to the energy of the **[scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md)**.
*   **Aetherium Spire:** A single, enormous spire of polished obsidian that somehow remained unbroken during The Sundering. The spire is perpetually wreathed in storms and radiates an unusual amount of arcane energy. Many believe it to be a focal point for the lingering power of the Aetherians and the key to unlocking the secrets of the Great [Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md).
*   **The Whispering Depths:** A seemingly bottomless trench located in the center of Aerthos. The trench is filled with a thick, black mist, and strange, ethereal whispers can be heard emanating from its depths. The [Cult of Dy](/structure/society/factions/cult-of-dy.md) believes this is a direct line to one of the three deities.

## Connection to Existing Lore

Aerthos’s connection to The Sundering adds a layer of tragedy and mystery to the world, hinting at the dangers of unchecked ambition and the potential consequences of tampering with powerful forces. The remnants of Aetherian technology and the lingering effects of the Great [Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) provide potential avenues for new technologies and magical discoveries. The strange creatures and anomalies that inhabit Aerthos can serve as formidable challenges and sources of valuable resources. The continent’s proximity to the **[Ornite Ring](/geography/scale/ornite-ring.md)** provides a unique opportunity to study the Ring’s influence on the world and to harness its power for good or ill. It's also speculated that some of the artifacts recovered by the Aetherians came from the sunken continent, which could explain some discrepancies in their technology.
