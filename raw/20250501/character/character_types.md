# Character Types of Mohinders

In the divided city of [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md), the nature of one’s origins and allegiances profoundly shapes their path and role. Beyond race and class, citizens often identify by a specialized type, heavily influenced by the city’s fractured societal structure and the magical currents that permeate it.

## Arcane Wardens

A prestigious and secretive order, Arcane Wardens are primarily Elven and Human scholars and [mages](/raw/20250504/mage/mages.md) dedicated to maintaining the stability of the city’s portal network. They trace their lineage back to the original architects of [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md)' intricate transportation system. Their training begins in childhood, focusing on portal theory, warding rituals, and the detection of magical anomalies. Wardens act as both guardians against unauthorized portal usage and investigators of unexplained dimensional shifts. Becoming a Warden grants access to the most closely guarded secrets of Mohinders’ [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), but demands unwavering loyalty to the Council and a strict adherence to protocol. They’re easily identifiable by their silver sigils and complex rune-embroidered robes.

## Shadow Runners

Born from the chaos of the portal divide, Shadow Runners are individuals who navigate the underground network of secret portals and hidden pathways that connect the two factions. Predominantly Halfling and Human, these skilled smugglers and information [brokers](/raw/20250501/broker/broker.md) thrive in the gray areas of [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md)’ society.  They are masters of disguise, possess an innate understanding of dimensional [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md), and often have contacts within both the Council’s enforcement agencies and the Veilbreaker resistance. Shadow Runners aren’t necessarily aligned with either faction, prioritizing survival and profit above all else. They are sought after by those who wish to bypass the strict portal regulations, but utilizing their services carries significant risk – not all routes are stable, and exposure is always a threat.

## Veilbreakers: Echo Forgers

A specialized cadre within the Veilbreaker resistance, Echo Forgers are individuals gifted with the rare ability to temporarily manipulate dimensional [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) – the residual energy left behind by unauthorized portal use. They can briefly open miniature, unstable portals, creating distractions, bypassing short distances, or relaying coded messages across the divide. Forging is a physically and magically taxing ability, requiring intense focus and precise control. Those who practice it are often ostracized by both factions, viewed as dangerous instigators and unpredictable wildcards. Their knowledge of echo manipulation is crucial to Veilbreaker operations, but their very existence presents a constant danger to the resistance’s security.

## Rune Siphons

An unsettling but increasingly common phenomenon, Rune Siphons are individuals whose bodies have begun to absorb and redirect the magical energy used in the city’s portal wards. This process is largely involuntary, often caused by prolonged exposure to unstable dimensional [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) or proximity to malfunctioning portal nodes. Siphons exhibit a strange, fluctuating aura and often experience memory loss and disorientation. The Council views them as a security risk, attempting to contain and study them, while Veilbreakers sometimes exploit their abilities to disrupt portal wards – though at great personal risk to the Siphon themselves.

## Portal Ghosts

Rare and tragic figures, Portal Ghosts are individuals trapped between dimensions due to catastrophic portal failures or unauthorized dimensional breaches. Their physical forms are fractured and fragmented, existing as [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) of their former selves. They haunt the fringes of [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md)’ dimensional network, sometimes manifesting as whispers, fleeting images, or pockets of unstable energy. While generally harmless, their presence disrupts portal function and serves as a chilling reminder of the dangers inherent in manipulating the Spiral. Some whisper that powerful [mages](/raw/20250504/mage/mages.md) can occasionally communicate with Portal Ghosts, gleaning fragments of lost knowledge or prophecies about the city’s future.
