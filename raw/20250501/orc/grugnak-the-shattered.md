# Grugnak the Shattered: A Legacy of Broken Plates

## A Son of Xaratius, Marked by Asara

Grugnak hails from the rugged, volcanic plains of Xaratius, a continent known for its hardy orcish clans and constant struggle for dominance.  He is a member of the 'Stonehand' clan, renowned for their strength and skill in crafting tools and weaponry – a tradition borne from necessity amidst the harsh landscapes of Xaratius.  However, Grugnak’s story is not one of simple adherence to tradition; it is a tale of loss, resilience, and a fractured connection to the mystical power that permeates [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md).

His name, “Grugnak the Shattered,” isn’t a title of honor, but a stark reminder of a pivotal event in his youth. As a promising apprentice stoneworker within the Stonehand clan, he participated in a traditional ritual - a pilgrimage to the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md) to receive a shard of its reflective crystal as a symbol of his dedication and connection to the land. Legend holds that the Asara Plate’s blue crystals resonate with the strength and fortitude of those who seek to use their skills for the betterment of their clan. During the ritual, tragedy struck. A band of [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md), seeking to plunder the Plate’s power, attacked the assembled orcs. In the ensuing chaos, Grugnak, attempting to protect his mentor, was caught in a blast of wild [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) unleashed during the Fangs’ desperate grab for the crystals.  The blast not only destroyed a significant portion of the crystal formations on the Plate but also irrevocably damaged Grugnak’s connection to [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md)'s magic, leaving him unable to harness the inherent energies that are commonplace amongst orcs and even [humans](/raw/20250501/human/humans.md).

## Scars and Skill: A Master Stoneworker

The magical scarring left Grugnak strangely unaffected in one respect: his innate skill with stone. Instead of hindering his craft, the chaotic [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) seems to have amplified it, granting him an almost preternatural ability to shape and mold rock with unprecedented speed and precision. He can discern structural weaknesses, anticipate stone’s reaction to stress, and carve intricate designs with remarkable ease. Though he can't channel magical energy to bolster his work, his sheer technical prowess has earned him a reputation as the most gifted stoneworker in Xaratius – a bitter irony considering the circumstances that earned him the title.

His physical scars are just as prominent as those he carries within.  A jagged line stretches across his left arm, a permanent reminder of the [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md)’ attack, and the explosion has left a permanent, almost imperceptible tremor in his hands.  Despite these limitations, Grugnak persists, channeling his frustration and grief into his work. He is a stoic and taciturn individual, rarely speaking unless necessary, preferring to communicate through the solidity and permanence of his creations.
