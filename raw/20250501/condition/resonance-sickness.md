# Resonance Sickness

[Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) Sickness is a debilitating, and increasingly common, condition affecting individuals who live within close proximity to a [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale/) or utilize refined [Scale Material](/geography/landmark/scale/). While initially dismissed as a minor affliction, its prevalence and severity have grown alongside the increasing utilization of [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) technology, sparking debate amongst scholars and healers alike. It is believed to be tied to the lingering presence of [Irion](/being/deity/irion)’s spirit, and the strange [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) left within the Scales themselves.

## Symptoms and Stages

[Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) Sickness doesn't present with a single, predictable set of symptoms. Instead, it manifests as a complex interplay of physical, mental, and emotional disturbances that progress through distinct stages. Early-stage symptoms are often subtle and easily dismissed as stress or fatigue. These can include:

*   **Auditory Hallucinations:** Whispers, [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md), and phantom sounds, often described as mimicking voices or landscapes from the past.
*   **Unstable Emotions:** Sudden shifts in mood, bouts of intense anxiety or depression, and an increased susceptibility to suggestion.
*   **Magnetic Discomfort:** A feeling of being pulled or repelled by [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-based technology or nearby geological formations.

As the illness progresses, symptoms escalate into the Intermediate Stage, characterized by:

*   **Physical Distortion:** Minor physical anomalies, such as fleeting visual distortions, phantom limb sensations, and temporary fluctuations in body temperature.
*   **Memory Fragmentation:**  Gaps in memory, false memories, and an inability to distinguish between real and imagined events.  These often pertain to events and locations associated with the nearest [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale/) or [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-refined objects. Some sufferers report reliving moments from [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md)’s distant past, which scholars attribute to the lingering [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)’s memories.
*   **[Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) Affinity:** A disturbing compulsion to seek out and touch [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale/) or Scale-based objects.  Resistance to this compulsion often results in intense pain and physical discomfort.

The final, and most dangerous, stage is the Terminal Stage.  Here, the afflicted individual’s body and mind become inextricably linked to the closest [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale/). Their physical form begins to blur and shift, mimicking the structure of the [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md), and their memories become entirely consumed by [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)'s past.  At this point, most individuals lose all sense of self, becoming little more than living conduits for Irion’s lingering presence.  The afflicted are often found motionless near the [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale/), radiating a palpable aura of magical energy.

## Theories of Origin and Mitigation

Several theories have emerged regarding the origin of [Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) Sickness, though a definitive explanation remains elusive. The prevailing theory centers around the lingering presence of [Irion](/being/deity/irion)’s spirit.  Some scholars believe that his residual essence permeates the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md), acting as a kind of magical 'imprint' that resonates with sentient beings.  The refined process of creating [Scale Material](/geography/landmark/scale/) is theorized to amplify this [resonance](/raw/20250504/cataclysm/resonance.md), making it more readily accessible and harmful.

Attempts at mitigation have proven largely unsuccessful.  Traditional healing methods offer little relief, and there are no known cures.  Some healers suggest relocating away from areas with high [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale/) density, but this is often impractical for communities reliant on [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) technology.  The [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md) are rumored to be experimenting with manipulating [the resonance](/raw/20250501/cataclysm/the-resonance.md) through the refinement of [Scale Material](/geography/landmark/scale/), but their methods are shrouded in secrecy and considered highly dangerous by most.

Rumors abound of rituals and artifacts connected to the Followers of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md) that purportedly offer limited protection from the illness. These remain largely unconfirmed, and access to their practices is tightly controlled.
