# Mohinders Governance: The Spiral Council and the Rune Wardens

## The Spiral Council: A Council of Representatives

The formal government of [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md) is the Spiral Council, a body comprised of representatives elected from each of the city’s designated Districts. These Districts are not geographic; instead, they are structured around guilds, craft specializations, and prominent institutions within the city. For example, the Emerald Compass (the city's main explorer's guild) has a dedicated District, as does the prestigious Fate and Sanctuary Enchanter's guild. Each District sends a single delegate, ostensibly chosen through a democratic process, although in practice, these positions are often secured through complex negotiations and influence peddling, heavily influenced by the guild leaders and patron nobles.

The Council itself meets within the Grand Confluence Chamber, a vast space where the city's magical leylines converge, amplifying the power of agreements and resolutions.  Their primary role is to regulate city-wide issues: taxation, infrastructure projects (like the upkeep of the intricate portal network), and the enforcement of city-wide laws. However, the Council's power is significantly limited by the Council of Rune Wardens, a body that holds a degree of subtle yet considerable control.

## The Council of Rune Wardens: Guardians of the Portal Network

Following the fracturing of the city's original unity, the Council of Rune Wardens emerged as an unexpected but essential force in [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md). This council is composed of the city’s most skilled [Runeswindlers](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders/runeswindler.md) – those [mages](/raw/20250504/mage/mages.md) proficient in manipulating and interpreting runes – and their primary duty is the maintenance and security of the portal network. The existence of the Spiral Council was originally conceived to govern the physical city; however, the Rune Wardens manage the city's *connections*—its vital magical arteries. Their power stems from their control over the flow of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) within the city. They can selectively restrict portal access, redirect magical energies, and even create temporary barriers between Districts. 

Each Rune Warden oversees a specific quadrant of the portal network, a responsibility passed down through generations. Becoming a Rune Warden isn’t merely about magical skill; it’s about proving loyalty to the stability of the city and an understanding of the delicate balance of power. They are not elected; instead, they are chosen from amongst the most promising [Runeswindlers](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders/runeswindler.md) by a secretive selection committee known as the Aetherium Covenant.

## Tensions and Power Dynamics

The relationship between the Spiral Council and the Rune Wardens is perpetually strained. The Council desires autonomy over all aspects of [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md), including the portal network, viewing the Rune Wardens' authority as an infringement on their mandate. The Rune Wardens, however, argue that their role is critical for the city’s survival and security, pointing to the potential for chaos if portal access is left unchecked.  

This inherent conflict manifests in subtle power plays, bureaucratic delays, and occasional open clashes. The Rune Wardens often use their control over the portal network to subtly influence District negotiations, restricting access to vital resources or disrupting trade routes to pressure reluctant Council members. Rumors abound of a clandestine network within the Rune Wardens seeking to solidify their position as the city’s true power [brokers](/raw/20250501/broker/broker.md), even advocating for a shift in the Council's charter to explicitly grant them more governing authority.

## The Aetherium Covenant: The Silent Watchers

Above both the Spiral Council and the Rune Wardens lies the Aetherium Covenant, a shadowy organization of ancient Runesmiths and [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) theorists. They are believed to be the original architects of the portal network and the guardians of its deepest secrets. The Covenant rarely intervenes directly in city affairs, preferring to observe and subtly guide events from the shadows.  While their motives remain opaque, it's widely believed that they seek to preserve the integrity of the portal network and prevent its misuse—even if it means overriding the decisions of both the Council and the Rune Wardens.

Some scholars believe the Aetherium Covenant holds the key to restoring [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md)' original unified state—to permanently sever the magical barriers between districts—but others fear that their intervention would unleash unpredictable magical forces that could destroy the city entirely.
