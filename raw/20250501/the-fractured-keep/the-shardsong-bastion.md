# The Shardsong Bastion

## A Remnant of Ancient Power

The Shardsong Bastion is a sprawling ruin located amidst the jagged peaks of the Meskjor mountain range, a testament to a forgotten age and a chilling echo of power. Unlike the predictable formations of the surrounding landscape, the Bastion seems to *writhe* against the natural order, its obsidian-like stone shimmering with faint, internal light – a spectral residue of the energy that once coursed through its core. Legends claim it was once the central stronghold of the Order of the Harmonious [Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md), a secretive group of [mages](/raw/20250504/mage/mages.md) who sought to harness the energy emanating from the magical [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) to create a nexus of incredible power and, purportedly, to open pathways between worlds. The Bastion's very construction was intrinsically tied to the [Ornite Ring](/geography/scale/ornite-ring.md), the colossal structure orbiting [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md), and its downfall is inextricably linked to the Ring’s fluctuating energies.

## The Resonance Cataclysm & The Fracturing

The Bastion’s history is dominated by a single, devastating event known as [the Resonance](/raw/20250501/cataclysm/the-resonance.md) Cataclysm.  Scholars theorize that the Order, in their relentless pursuit of power, attempted a ritual to draw directly upon the [Ornite Ring](/geography/scale/ornite-ring.md)'s energy – an act deemed reckless even by those who practice the more pragmatic forms of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md).  It is believed that the energies of the Ring, unstable and unpredictable, were amplified within the Bastion’s intricate network of runes and arcane conduits.  Instead of a controlled influx of power, the ritual triggered a catastrophic feedback loop, resulting in a massive energy surge that violently shattered the Bastion and unleashed chaotic ripples of magic across Meskjor.  The event was accompanied by sonic blasts of immense power - the “Shardsong” – from which the Bastion derives its name. It is said these blasts created fissures deep within the mountains, some even leading to the [Dense](/geography/cosmology/plane-of-existance/the-dense).

The physical [manifestation](/structure/chronological/event/manifestation.md) of this catastrophe is starkly evident today. The Bastion is a collection of enormous, fragmented structures – enormous walls, shattered towers, and colossal arches – suspended in mid-air by lingering arcane energies. These floating remnants drift slowly within a radius of several miles, a constant reminder of the Cataclysm’s destructive power. The original design of the Bastion remains partially visible in the way these fragments align, suggesting a carefully crafted structure now forever broken.

## Current Inhabitants and Dangers

Though seemingly deserted, the Shardsong Bastion is far from uninhabited. The residual [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) clinging to the ruins has warped the local fauna and attracted creatures attuned to chaotic energy. Mutated strains of mountain wolves, known as “Echo Hounds,” prowl the floating wreckage, their howls echoing distorted refrains of the Shardsong. Additionally,
