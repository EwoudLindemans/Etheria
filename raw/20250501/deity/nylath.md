# Nylath, the Weaver of Echoes

Nylath is a relatively obscure [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md), gaining prominence only in recent centuries as the phenomena surrounding the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) – particularly the unsettling [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) they seem to emit – have become more pronounced. Unlike the more tangible and well-established deities like [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md), Nylath isn't invoked with prayers or offerings. Instead, Nylath is recognized as the force behind the '[resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md)'—the lingering psychic imprint left by events that occurred near the scales. It is believed that the emotional and magical energy woven into the very fabric of reality remains embedded within them, and Nylath is the embodiment of this spectral tapestry.

## Domains and Associations

Nylath’s domain is not one of power or creation, but of memory and preservation. They are associated with:

*   **[Echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) & [Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md):** The lingering psychic impressions around the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md), especially potent near damaged or fragmented ones.
*   **Lost Histories:** Nylath is invoked (albeit subconsciously) by those seeking to understand the events of the distant past – battles fought near [Umperas Hull](/geography/scale/umperas-hull.md), ceremonies held within the shadow of the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md), the rise and fall of forgotten civilizations near the [Ornite Ring](/geography/scale/ornite-ring.md).
*   **The Unseen Paths:** It’s whispered that Nylath shows glimpses of alternate timelines and ‘what ifs’ to those sensitive enough to perceive them, manifesting as fleeting images and disquieting emotions.
*   **The Emotionally Scarred:** Those who have experienced significant trauma, especially events linked to [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) energies, often find themselves drawn to Nylath, either consciously or unconsciously, seeking a sense of connection or understanding.

## Followers and Cults

While not possessing organized temples, Nylath attracts a few distinct groups:

*   **The Aural Scribes:** A clandestine order of individuals with rare sensitivity to [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) [resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md). They meticulously record and analyze these [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md), attempting to reconstruct lost histories and predict future events based on patterns within [the resonance](/raw/20250501/cataclysm/the-resonance.md). Many Aural Scribes are exiled historians or individuals cast out from traditional academic circles who dismissed their claims as madness.
*   **The Remembrance Circles:** Small, localized groups who gather near [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) to share stories of loss, trauma, and remembrance. They believe that by acknowledging these emotions, they can lessen [the resonance](/raw/20250501/cataclysm/the-resonance.md)'s intensity and potentially mend the emotional scars of the past.
*   **[The Resonance](/raw/20250501/cataclysm/the-resonance.md) Seekers:** This fringe group actively pursues powerful [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) [resonances](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md), believing they hold the key to unlocking ancient knowledge or even achieving a form of immortality through absorbing the [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) of past lives.

## Symbol and Appearance

Nylath has no definitive symbol. Depictions, when they appear, are rarely consistent. Most commonly, they are represented as a shimmering, indistinct form resembling a shattered mirror reflecting countless fragmented images. Some accounts describe them as a voice – a chorus of whispers too faint to understand yet profoundly unsettling.

## Relation to Other Deities

Nylath’s relationship to [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md) is complex. Some theorize that Nylath is merely an aspect of Irion – the part of the creature that embodies the memories and emotions left behind. Others believe that Nylath is a consequence of Irion’s diminishing power, a spectral residue of a once-grand being. The [Cult of Dy](/structure/society/factions/cult-of-dy.md) dismisses the notion of Nylath, claiming that its [resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) is merely a random occurrence determined by the rolling of the dice.
