# Ore and Alloy Refinement: A Heartforge Primer

This guide details the process of refining ores and crafting alloys at the [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md), a crucial element of Or's technological and cultural landscape. It is intended for [Heartsmith](/raw/20250501/profession/heartsmith.md) [apprentices](/raw/20250501/scholar/apprentices.md), Order initiates, and those with a keen interest in the intricacies of material creation within our world.

## Understanding the Raw Materials

Before venturing into refinement, a thorough understanding of the raw ores is paramount. Each ore exhibits unique planar [resonances](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) and inherent magical properties, influencing the final alloy’s capabilities. Remember, improper handling can lead to volatile reactions and unpredictable results.

### Scaleforged Ores
These ores, uniquely exposed by the Deepening Fracture, pulse with the Heart's planar energies. They are categorized by their dominant [resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md):

*   **Emberstone:** A fiery ore resonating with primal destruction and transformative heat. Prone to spontaneous combustion if not stabilized.
*   **Shadowquartz:** A cool, absorbing ore tied to memory and concealment. Highly sought after for its ability to dampen magical signatures.
*   **Lumite:** A radiant ore that emanates soft light and enhances planar communication. Considered a source of subtle hope in a darkened world.
*   **Veinstone:** A foundational ore, embodying the enduring strength of the earth. Its planar connection is relatively muted but provides stability in alloy crafting.

### Memory Shards
These crystallized fragments of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)'s essence are harvested from the Veil Threads and imbued into the ores to establish a deeper connection and unlock higher-level alloy properties.  Shards are classified by their 'Echo' – a subtle spectral variation revealing the specific weave of planar energy they hold. Selecting the correct Echo is vital for achieving the desired alloy characteristics.

## The Refinement Process

The [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md)’s process is a delicate dance between physical and planar manipulation, orchestrated by the [Heartsmiths](/raw/20250501/profession/heartsmith.md) and overseen by the Order's Threadwalkers.

### Initial Stabilization
The first stage involves neutralizing the ores' inherent volatility. Emberstone requires a cooling bath of Shadowquartz dust, while Lumite necessitates a [resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) dampener to prevent uncontrolled light emissions.

### Planar Infusion
This crucial step involves introducing the Memory Shards, guided by the Threadwalker. Precise alignment of the Shard’s Echo with the ore’s [resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) allows for a deeper connection, unlocking latent properties. Misalignment can lead to a
