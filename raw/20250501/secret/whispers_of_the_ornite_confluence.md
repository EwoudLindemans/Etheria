# Whispers of the Ornite Confluence

## The Celestial Resonance

The [Ornite Ring](/geography/scale/ornite-ring.md), a perpetually visible celestial structure encircling [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md), has always been a source of wonder and speculation. While commonly regarded as a remnant of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)'s power or a divine boundary, a fringe sect within the [Follower’s of Irion](/structure/society/factions/followers-of-irion.md), known as the 'Celestial Harmonists,' believes the Ring is far more interactive and significant than previously understood. Their research, gleaned from fragmented prophecies and ancient acoustic readings, suggests the Ring isn't simply an observation point, but an immense, resonating instrument, constantly attuned to the collective emotional state of Iridia’s sentient beings.

## The Harmonic Matrix

The Celestial Harmonists theorize that the Ring’s luminescence – its distinctive red inner lining – isn’t merely light, but a tangible [manifestation](/structure/chronological/event/manifestation.md) of what they term the 'Harmonic Matrix.' This Matrix is composed of ambient magical energy, drawn directly from [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md)’s biosphere and filtered through the Ring’s vast, unknown mechanisms.  Each sentient being’s emotional output—joy, fear, anger—contributes a specific vibrational frequency to this Matrix.  Positive emotions generate harmonic frequencies, strengthening the Ring’s glow and influencing subtle shifts in Iridia’s natural order. Conversely, pervasive negativity weakens the Ring and can, according to the Harmonists’ more extreme prophecies, cause catastrophic disruptions.

## The Confluence Points

Most intriguing, however, is the discovery of what the Harmonists call 'Confluence Points.' These are localized areas on [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md)'s surface that demonstrate an unusually strong [resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) with the [Ornite Ring](/geography/scale/ornite-ring.md). Areas such as the [Triz Valley](/geography/settlement/city/triz-valley.md) and certain locations beneath the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md) are demonstrably more affected by collective emotional states. Increased happiness or harmony in these locations noticeably brighten the Ring, while discordance dims it.  

The Harmonists have theorized that [The Dense](/geography/realm/the-dense.md) and whatever lies beyond, is an immense emotional void where negativity reigns, that greatly affects the [Ornite Ring](/geography/scale/ornite-ring.md).

## The Ritual of Attunement

To better understand the Ring's function, the Harmonists have developed a controversial ritual called ‘Attunement.’ This ritual, performed exclusively at Confluence Points, involves focused meditation and synchronized emotional projection by a select group of initiates. The goal is to deliberately manipulate the Harmonic Matrix, testing the Ring's responsiveness and attempting to glean further information about its mechanisms. Some claim Attunement has yielded fleeting visions of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md)'s distant past, while others warn of the risks involved—that uncontrolled emotional projection can trigger unpredictable surges in the Harmonic Matrix, potentially attracting unwanted attention from beyond the Ring's veil.

## Connection to Arcane Fangs

The [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md) have taken notice of these findings and seek to monopolize them. The leader of the Fangs has sent a group to locate the locations of the convergence points and develop ways to artificially enhance these points. They hope to use them as generators to infuse their gear and soldiers with magical power. 

## Risk and Reward

The Celestial Harmonists' research, though groundbreaking, is shrouded in secrecy and regarded with suspicion by the broader Follower’s of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md). Some within the organization fear that tampering with the [Ornite Ring](/geography/scale/ornite-ring.md) could have unforeseen consequences, potentially upsetting the delicate balance that sustains [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md). The risk of unleashing chaotic energies or attracting unwelcome entities from beyond remains a constant concern. However, the potential reward—unlocking the Ring’s full potential and gaining a deeper understanding of Iridia’s connection to the cosmos—continues to drive the Celestial Harmonists forward, despite the dangers that lie ahead.
