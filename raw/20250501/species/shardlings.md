# Shardlings

Shardlings are a unique and enigmatic species native to [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md), intrinsically linked to the magical [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) scattered across the world. They are not born in the traditional sense; rather, they spontaneously coalesce from ambient magical energy, particularly in areas where scales are damaged or actively radiating power. Their existence is fleeting, typically lasting no more than a few decades, though exceptionally rare individuals have been recorded surviving for over a century.

## Appearance and Physiology

Shardlings are humanoid in form, but their bodies are composed of interlocking crystalline shards that shimmer with an internal light. The color of these shards varies wildly depending on the type of [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) that influenced their creation. Shardlings born near an Umpera Hull are typically yellow or orange, while those near the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md) are often shades of blue. Their forms are not static; shards constantly shift and rearrange themselves, creating a mesmerizing, almost liquid appearance despite their crystalline nature.  They have no discernible internal organs; their consciousness seems to reside within the network of connected shards, allowing them to rapidly regenerate from almost any injury. However, damage to their core shard (a larger, more stable shard located within their chest cavity) can be fatal.

## Behavior and Society

Shardlings are generally solitary creatures, drawn to areas of high magical concentration. While not inherently aggressive, they are fiercely protective of the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) that spawned them.  They exhibit a peculiar form of sentience - a near-intuitive understanding of magical energies. They are often found subtly manipulating nearby scales, mending cracks or diverting energy flows. Although they don't build settlements in the traditional sense, groups of Shardlings sometimes congregate near particularly powerful scales, engaging in a silent, almost meditative existence.

While they rarely interact with other races, Shardlings possess a deep-seated curiosity about the world beyond their immediate surroundings. Some individuals, known as 'Seekers,' have been observed venturing far from their [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md), drawn by rumors of ancient ruins or powerful artifacts. These Seekers often attempt to communicate with other races, though their methods are often clumsy and misinterpreted, leading to suspicion and fear. Some believe the Seekers are sent by [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md), guiding lost [souls](/raw/20250501/soul/soul.md).

## Connection to the Scales and Irion

The connection between Shardlings and the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) is profound.  Their lifespan is directly tied to the health and stability of the scale they originated from. Damage to the scale weakens the Shardling, hastening its decline. Conversely, a flourishing scale can subtly enhance their abilities and prolong their life.  Many scholars theorize that Shardlings are fragments of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)'s dispersed consciousness, manifesting as guardians of the scales – a means of preserving the legacy of the creature’s immense power.  Their silent tending to the scales is believed by some [Followers of Irion](/structure/society/factions/followers-of-irion.md) to be direct [manifestations](/structure/chronological/event/manifestation.md) of Irion’s wishes.

## Weaknesses

* **Core Shard Vulnerability:** Damage to the core shard is almost always fatal.
* **[Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) Dependency:** Their life force is tied to the health of their origin scale.
* **Sonic Disruption:** Intense sonic vibrations can disrupt the resonant frequency of their crystalline structure, causing disorientation and pain.
* **Aetherium Exposure:** Prolonged exposure to Aetherium, a rare and unstable magical substance, causes rapid disintegration.
