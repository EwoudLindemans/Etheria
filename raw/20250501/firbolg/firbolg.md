# Firbolg: The Stone-Touched Folk

Firbolg are a reclusive and ancient race, deeply connected to the land and uniquely attuned to the energy radiating from [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md)'s magical [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md). Often mistaken for giants due to their considerable height, they are characterized by their gentle nature, their exceptional craftwork, and a peculiar 'stone-touch' - a gift (or burden, depending on the individual) that allows them to manipulate stone and earth.

## Origins and History

Legends whisper that the firbolg were initially formed from the petrified tears of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md), the primordial being whose essence still [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) within the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md). As such, they are inherently tied to the wellspring of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), and their numbers dwindled significantly following the Great Sundering, when many scales fractured or were lost, disrupting the flow of magic. The stone-touch, while present in all firbolg, is believed to have intensified over generations, evolving as a response to the weakened magical flow, enabling them to reinforce and even heal damaged scales.

While generally peaceful, firbolg have a long history of guarding the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) from exploitation. They view themselves as caretakers, obligated to protect these sources of power from those who would abuse them, particularly the [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md) and those seeking to exploit the scales for personal gain. Their reclusive nature is not born of malice, but rather a deep desire to preserve the delicate balance between [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) and its magical heartbeat.

## Physical Characteristics & Stone-Touch

Firbolg stand between 7 and 9 feet tall, possessing a sturdy build reminiscent of weathered stone. Their skin tones range from deep grays and mossy greens to the pale hues of granite.  They have broad faces, often adorned with intricate carvings resembling the patterns found on the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) themselves, which develop over their lifetime and are considered marks of wisdom and connection to the earth. Their eyes are large and soulful, often displaying a faint luminescent quality – a subtle reflection of the [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) flowing through their veins.

The Stone-Touch is the defining feature of the firbolg. It manifests in different ways: some can mend cracks in stone with a touch, others can coax plants to grow with incredible speed, while some skilled artisans can sculpt elaborate stone structures without the use of tools. More rarely, a firbolg might possess a '[Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md)' – the ability to sense and even influence the energy flow within a [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md). These individuals are often sought after as scale-wardens or protectors.

## Culture and Society

Firbolg society is deeply rooted in tradition and reverence for the earth. They live in secluded villages built into the natural landscape, often incorporating existing rock formations into their homes. Their craftwork is renowned throughout [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) – particularly their intricate stone carvings and their ability to create tools and structures that seamlessly blend with the surrounding environment. 

Their leadership is based on a council of elders known as the Stone-Speakers. These elders are chosen for their wisdom, their understanding of the earth, and their ability to interpret the subtle shifts in the [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)’s energy. Disputes are resolved through meditation and careful consideration of the earth's perspective, rather than through conflict. Music and storytelling are integral to their [culture](/raw/20250501/dwarf/culture.md), often conveying ancient tales of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md) and the importance of protecting the scales.

## Relationship with Other Races

Firbolg are generally wary of outsiders, preferring to avoid contact with other races whenever possible. However, they are not inherently hostile. Those who demonstrate respect for the earth and a genuine desire to understand their ways may find them to be helpful and insightful guides. They share a cautious respect for the followers of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md), recognizing their shared purpose of safeguarding the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md), though disagreements over methods are not uncommon. Relations with the [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md) are, predictably, strained, with firbolg often acting as a silent, yet formidable, barrier against their incursions.
