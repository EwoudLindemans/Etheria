# Whispers of the Abyssal Resonance

Rumors are the lifeblood of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md), swirling through markets, taverns, and shadowed alleys. While most prove to be exaggerations or outright falsehoods, certain persistent whispers carry a weight that demands attention.  These are the currents of the Abyssal [Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md), tales that hint at a terrifying truth about the world’s [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) themselves.

## The Echoes of Irion's Song

Perhaps the most unsettling rumor speaks of ‘[Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)’s Echo.’ It’s claimed that some individuals, particularly those with a deep connection to [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) or those who spend prolonged periods near a [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md), begin to hear a low, resonating hum. This isn't a sound audible to everyone; those affected describe it as a feeling more than a hearing – a vibration deep within their bones. The intensity grows with proximity to the scale, and some claim the hum occasionally coalesces into fragmented phrases, echoing what sounds like Irion’s lament.

Those who experience this phenomenon often suffer debilitating headaches, paranoia, and an obsessive desire to understand the ‘song.’  The Followers of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md) dismiss these accounts as the ravings of the magically unstable, but whispers persist that these afflicted are receiving warnings – warnings about something awakening within the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md).

## Scale Bleeding – A Corrupting Influence

Another prevalent rumor speaks of ‘[Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) Bleeding.’ It's said that when a scale fractures or suffers significant damage, it doesn't simply break into harmless shards. Instead, a viscous, oily substance, shimmering with trapped magical energy, leaks from the wound. This substance, known as ‘[Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) Residue,’ is incredibly dangerous. Contact with [Resonance](/raw/20250504/cataclysm/resonance.md) Residue is said to cause rapid and unpredictable mutations.  

Reports vary, but common symptoms include uncontrolled growth of bones and limbs, shifts in skin color, and the spontaneous generation of crystalline formations on the body. Those afflicted rarely survive the transformation, and those who do are said to become thralls to whatever ancient force dwells within the [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md). [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md) are rumored to deliberately sabotage scales to harvest [the Resonance](/raw/20250501/cataclysm/the-resonance.md) Residue, despite the obvious risks. 

## The Unbinding – Scales Beyond Iridia

The most terrifying rumor, shared only in hushed tones, concerns the 'Unbinding'. Legend suggests that the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) weren't always bound to [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md). Some theorize they were once scattered across a vast, forgotten continent, an ancient civilization built upon their power.  

The rumor claims that certain individuals, primarily those studying ancient texts or exploring uncharted regions, have stumbled upon faint traces of these lost [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) – shimmering anomalies detected through specialized divination rituals. More disturbing, some scholars believe that these 'lost scales' are subtly influencing [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md)'s environment, causing strange weather patterns and unsettling seismic activity.  

Most dismiss this as fanciful speculation, but the increased frequency of strange occurrences in previously stable regions lends the rumor a chilling plausibility. The [Cult of Dy](/structure/society/factions/cult-of-dy.md), unsurprisingly, views the possibility of a lost continent as proof of Dy’s random nature and the capriciousness of the cosmos. They propose a ritual to determine if the Unbinding is approaching through a series of increasingly dangerous trials.
