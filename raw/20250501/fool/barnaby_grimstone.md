# Barnaby Grimstone, the Scale-Seer

Barnaby Grimstone is a relatively new and increasingly infamous figure in the world of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md), quickly gaining notoriety despite (or perhaps because of) his utter lack of demonstrable talent. He’s a self-proclaimed “[Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-Seer,” claiming to possess the ability to interpret the residual magical [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) emanating from the colossal magical Scales – remnants of a long-vanished, godlike creature named [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md).

## A Peddler of Nonsense

Barnaby operates primarily near the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md), drawn to the unique crystal formations within and the bustling trade routes passing beneath it. He positions himself as an oracle, offering insights and predictions based on supposed “readings” of the Plate’s crystalline energies. These “readings” consist largely of rambling, cryptic pronouncements – a bizarre mix of misinterpreted historical snippets, overheard conversations, and outright fabrications. He peppers his pronouncements with pseudo-scientific jargon he clearly doesn's understand, attempting to lend an air of legitimacy to his claims.

His audience is a motley collection: curious merchants hoping for advantageous trade tips, desperate travelers seeking guidance on safe passage, and easily-influenced townsfolk yearning for a sense of destiny. Barnaby is a skilled storyteller and, more importantly, an excellent listener. He subtly incorporates elements of his audience's concerns and desires into his readings, creating a personalized narrative that feels remarkably insightful – even when it’s utter nonsense. Remarkably, some of his pronouncements have, by sheer coincidence, come true, fueling his reputation and attracting a larger following.  It's widely speculated he has spies among the caravans and merchants, subtly feeding him information.

## A Pawn in Larger Games?

While most dismiss Barnaby as a harmless charlatan, a disturbing number of influential figures take an unnatural interest in his pronouncements. Representatives from both the [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md) and Gorgraths Wrath have been observed discreetly monitoring his “readings.” Some believe he’s a genuine, albeit utterly clueless, conduit to [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)’s power – an unlikely channel for the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md)’ [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md). Others suspect he’s a deliberate pawn, skillfully manipulated by one of these organizations to spread disinformation or identify potential targets.

The [Cult of Dy](/structure/society/factions/cult-of-dy.md), ever-seeking patterns, have also begun observing Barnaby's movements, intrigued by the seemingly random nature of his 'predictions'. They're attempting to determine if there's a pattern to his successes and failures, and if so, what [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md) is influencing his readings.

Rumours circulate that Barnaby owes a significant debt to a rather unpleasant member of the Sisterhood of Assassination, suggesting a possible motivation for his continued charade - staying alive.

## Potential Plot Hooks
