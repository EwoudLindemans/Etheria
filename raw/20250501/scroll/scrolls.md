# Scrolls: Carriers of Echoes

[Scrolls](/raw/20250504/scroll/scrolls.md) in Or are not mere repositories of written knowledge; they are intricate constructs woven from scaled parchment, infused with residual planar energy, and often serve as [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) of powerful events or individuals. Their creation and use are tightly regulated by the Lorekeepers of Or, a branch of the Order dedicated to preserving both knowledge and the planar safety of the realm.

## Types of Scrolls

[Scrolls](/raw/20250504/scroll/scrolls.md) are categorized based on their construction, origin, and inherent magical properties:

### Scaled Parchment Scrolls

The most common type, these [scrolls](/raw/20250504/scroll/scrolls.md) utilize specially treated Scalewrought Vein parchment. The [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md), meticulously stripped and pressed, retain subtle planar [resonances](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md), making them uniquely receptive to magical inscription. They are favored for their relative durability and the clarity of imprinted runes.

#### Inscribed Scrolls

Basic [scrolls](/raw/20250504/scroll/scrolls.md) containing written text, diagrams, or formulas. Their value lies in the information they contain, ranging from mining maps to complex metallurgical formulas, vital for [Heartforge](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/heartforge.md) operations.

#### Echo-Bound Scrolls

These are the most significant. Created during moments of intense magical or emotional [resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) – a clash of Veilsteel blades, the moment of a Memory Shard’s anchoring, a powerful invocation – the parchment absorbs a sliver of that event. When activated, they briefly replay the sensory [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) of that moment: sights, sounds, and even faint traces of emotions.

#### Rune-Locked Scrolls

Containing carefully crafted runes that, when properly activated, trigger controlled magical effects. These can range from simple illumination to protective wards. Rune-Locked [Scrolls](/raw/20250504/scroll/scrolls.md) are painstakingly created and guarded, as their power can be dangerous in untrained hands.

### Memory Shard Scrolls

A rarer and more potent form, created by anchoring fragments of Memory Shards directly into the parchment. These [scrolls](/raw/20250504/scroll/scrolls.md) hold significantly greater planar energy and allow for more powerful, sustained effects. They are intensely sought after by the Order and guarded with the utmost secrecy.

#### Vision Scrolls

Allowing the user to briefly glimpse fragmented memories linked to the Shard. Used primarily by Threadwalkers to study Veil patterns.

#### Binding Scrolls

More dangerous, these attempt to bind ephemeral [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) to the user, providing a fleeting surge of power or skill - but at the risk of instability and planar bleed.

### Vigil Scrolls

Unique [scrolls](/raw/20250504/scroll/scrolls.md) used in the Vigil of the Deep. They are blank Scaled Parchment scrolls imprinted with a miner's likeness. Once the miner passes on, the scroll is placed within the Memorial Vault of the city, absorbing the lingering [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) of their life and deeds, serving as a poignant reminder of Or's sacrifices. The [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) patterns shift subtly over decades, reflecting the reverberations of the individual’s life.

## Creation and Lorekeepers

The crafting of [scrolls](/raw/20250504/scroll/scrolls.md) is a carefully regulated process overseen by the Lorekeepers of Or, a specialized Order branch. Only those who have undergone years of rigorous planar safety training are permitted to create or utilize these devices.

*   **Ink of [Echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md):**  Specialized ink made from crushed, purified Echo Dust – a byproduct of planar convergences. Its composition varies based on the intended effect of the scroll.
*   **Runecrafting Techniques:**  Lorekeepers employ ancient, precise runecrafting methods, passed down through generations. Incorrect runes can result in volatile or unpredictable results.
*   **Planar [Resonance](/raw/20250501/resonance/resonance.md) Alignment:** Each scroll is carefully aligned with subtle planar energies to ensure stability and prevent unwanted bleed.

## Risks and Regulations

The use of [scrolls](/raw/20250504/scroll/scrolls.md) is fraught with risks. Improper use can cause planar instability, draw unwanted attention from Veil entities, or even inflict lasting mental trauma. Consequently, the Lorekeepers enforce strict regulations:

*   **Scroll Permits:**  Individuals must obtain a permit from the Lorekeepers before possessing or utilizing a scroll.
*   **Restricted Zones:**  Certain areas, particularly near Veil Threads, are designated as Scroll-Free Zones.
*   **Memory Bleed:** Users of Memory Shard [Scrolls](/raw/20250504/scroll/scrolls.md) risk experiencing Memory Bleed – a condition where the scroll’s memories begin to merge with their own, leading to confusion and instability. 

Despite the risks, [scrolls](/raw/20250504/scroll/scrolls.md) remain an indispensable tool for the dwarves of Or, serving as conduits of knowledge, [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) of the past, and potential keys to the future.
