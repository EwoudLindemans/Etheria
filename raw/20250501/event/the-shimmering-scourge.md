# The Shimmering Scourge

## A Wave of Crystallization

For generations, the people of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) have been aware of the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) – colossal remnants of a power long past. While many saw them as sources of magical energy, or geological anomalies, few anticipated the emergence of the Shimmering Scourge. It began subtly – reports from miners in the [Mountains of Triz](/geography/region/mountains-of-triz.md) detailed the sudden formation of crystalline growths within the rock face, shimmering with an unnatural, internal light. Initially dismissed as unusual mineral deposits, the reports escalated, speaking of rapid expansion and an unsettling effect on local flora and fauna. These creatures were seemingly transformed, their bodies overtaken by crystalline structures, retaining a semblance of their original form but radiating a cold, unsettling energy.

## The Spread and its Effects

The phenomenon wasn't confined to the [Mountains of Triz](/geography/region/mountains-of-triz.md). Reports began trickling in from near the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md), the [Umperas Hull](/geography/scale/umperas-hull.md), and even faintly near the edges of the [Ornite Ring](/geography/scale/ornite-ring.md). Wherever a [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) exerted a notable influence, the shimmering crystals appeared. The crystals themselves possess a unique property: they absorb and refract ambient magical energy, amplifying it and redirecting it into erratic bursts. This has led to unpredictable magical fluctuations in affected areas, disrupting established enchantments, and causing localized weather anomalies. More worryingly, any living creature exposed to prolonged contact with the crystals begins to undergo a similar transformation, slowly becoming a crystalline being.

The [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md), ever opportunistic, are scrambling to understand and exploit the Scourge, believing it represents a new and immense source of magical power. The [Cult of Dy](/structure/society/factions/cult-of-dy.md), however, interprets it as a direct consequence of the deities' shifting whims, a divine test of resilience, or a chaotic display of their power.  The Followers of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md) are deeply concerned, viewing the event as a desecration of the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md), a sign of Irion’s fading presence, or an unwelcome intrusion upon the world.
