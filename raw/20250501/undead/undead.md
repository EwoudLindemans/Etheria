# Undead of Iridia

The rise and fall of civilizations has left an indelible mark on [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md), and with it, a haunting legacy of the undead. Unlike the simple, mindless skeletons of legend, the undead of Iridia are frequently warped reflections of their former selves, infused with residual magical energies and occasionally, [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) of their former personalities. The nature of their existence is intrinsically linked to the presence of the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md), the source of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) that permeates the world.

## Origins and Varieties

Undead on [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) rarely arise through simple necromantic rituals. While such practices are known, the vast majority are born from traumatic magical events or prolonged exposure to the residual energies emanating from the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) themselves. The closer a corpse is to a Scale when it falls, the more complex and dangerous the resulting undead form.

*   **[Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-Bound Shades:** These are the most common type, arising from individuals who died near a Scale and whose spirits have become inextricably bound to it. They often retain fragments of their memories and skills, though twisted and corrupted by the Scale's influence. These Shades are driven by a desperate longing to return to their former lives, and may attempt to interact with the living, often in unsettling ways.
*   **Resonants:** These are significantly rarer. Resonants are formed when a deceased individual possessed a strong connection to a particular [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)â€”perhaps they were a revered artisan whose work incorporated Scale energy, or a powerful mage who dedicated their life to studying them. These undead retain much of their former intellect and magical abilities, albeit warped and amplified. They often possess a chilling sense of purpose, driven by goals related to the Scale they were linked to.
*   **Graveforged:** The most terrifying and dangerous form, Graveforged are created when bodies are exposed to prolonged contact with damaged or unstable [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md). The resulting process fundamentally alters their physiology, fusing bone and flesh with crystalline formations similar to the Scales themselves. They are incredibly durable, possess enhanced strength and magical resistance, and often spew raw Scale energy in corrupted blasts.
*   **Echo-Thralls:** Found primarily in the vicinity of the [Ornite Ring](/geography/scale/ornite-ring.md), these are spectral beings that are formed when strong emotions of regret, despair, or anger remain after a person's death. They don't truly
