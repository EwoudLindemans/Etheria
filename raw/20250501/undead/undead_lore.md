# Undead of Iridia

The prevalence of magical [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) and volatile magical energy has gifted [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) with a unique and disturbing phenomenon: [undead](/raw/20250501/undead/undead.md), far removed from the typical concept of animated corpses. While reanimated skeletons and zombies certainly exist, often created through crude necromantic rituals or localized surges of corrupting [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), the true undead of Iridia are profoundly intertwined with the scales themselves.

## Scale-Bound Revenants

The most common form of [undead](/raw/20250501/undead/undead.md) are the [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-Bound Revenants. These are individuals who died while in close proximity to a magical scale, or whose [souls](/raw/20250501/soul/soul.md) were somehow tethered to one. The scale acts as an anchor, preventing the soul from fully departing and drawing it back to the physical realm. The strength of the scale influences the strength and form of the Revenant.  A Revenant tied to the [Umperas Hull](/geography/scale/umperas-hull.md), for instance, might retain memories of their life, and even retain a degree of sentience, while those bound to weaker, fragmented scales might be little more than mindless puppets.

**[Manifestations](/structure/chronological/event/manifestation.md):** [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-Bound Revenants often exhibit physical traits reflecting the scale they are bound to.  Revenants of the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md) might possess shimmering blue skin and a sensitivity to light. Those linked to the [Ornite Ring](/geography/scale/ornite-ring.md) might leave trails of shimmering red dust wherever they tread. The color and appearance of their decay is also influenced by the scale – a Revenant of the yellow [Umperas Hull](/geography/scale/umperas-hull.md) might exhibit a strangely preserved state, with skin retaining a faint yellow hue.

**[Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) Dependence:** The most critical aspect of a Scale-Bound Revenant is their dependence on their scale.  If the scale is destroyed or significantly damaged, the Revenant typically dissipates, their [soul](/raw/20250501/soul/soul.md) finally released. Conversely, manipulating or enhancing the scale can influence the Revenant – bolstering its strength, altering its abilities, or even offering a limited form of control.

## Echo Wraiths

Beyond the relatively “simple” [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-Bound Revenants are the Echo Wraiths. These entities are born not from a single scale, but from residual magical energy that accumulates in areas strongly influenced by multiple scales. These “nodes” of accumulated [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) distort the veil between worlds, giving rise to spectral beings composed of solidified [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) – fragmented memories, emotions, and sensations left behind by countless beings who have passed through those areas.

**Appearance and Behavior:** Echo Wraiths are amorphous, shifting forms, often appearing as hazy, distorted figures. They don’t possess a fixed personality; instead, they exhibit traits and memories plucked from the surrounding environment. An Echo Wraith near the ruins of [Triz Valley](/geography/settlement/city/triz-valley.md), for example, might repeatedly re-enact scenes of battle, or whisper snippets of old songs. They are generally non-hostile, driven only by the compulsion to re-enact these memories, although their erratic behavior can be unsettling.

**Vulnerability:** Echo Wraiths are highly susceptible to disruptions of magical energy. Dampening fields or the shattering of nearby [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) can quickly destabilize them, causing them to flicker and fade.

## The Scourge of the Dense

The most terrifying [undead](/raw/20250501/undead/undead.md) of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) are believed to originate from the cracks between continents and the strange depths of [The Dense](/geography/realm/the-dense.md). They are known as the Scourge, corrupted entities twisted by the volatile energies within those depths. Unlike [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-Bound Revenants, the Scourge are not tethered to specific scales; instead, they are vessels for pure, malignant magical energy, manifesting as grotesque and powerful undead.

**Characteristics:**  The Scourge are incredibly resilient, resistant to conventional weaponry and [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md). Their forms are constantly shifting and evolving, incorporating fragments of [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) and remnants of past victims. They possess an insatiable hunger for magical energy, draining the life force from anything they touch.

**Connection to the [Ornite Ring](/geography/scale/ornite-ring.md):** Rumors persist that the Ornite Ring is not merely a remnant of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)'s power, but a celestial barrier intended to contain the Scourge from spreading across [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md). The weakening of the Ring, therefore, is seen as a harbinger of a coming plague.
