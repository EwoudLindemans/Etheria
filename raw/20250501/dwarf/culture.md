# Dwarves of Iridia: Culture and Craft

## A People Forged in Stone

Dwarves of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) are renowned for their resilience, their skill in crafting, and their deep connection to the earth. Unlike surface-dwelling races, dwarven society is intrinsically linked to the deep mines and cavernous halls beneath the surface. This has shaped their culture, their beliefs, and their very way of life, fostering a tradition of practicality, meticulousness, and unwavering loyalty.

## The Clan System and Ancestral Lore

At the heart of dwarven society lies the Clan system. While the Great Flatstone Family holds sway in the bustling [city of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md), dwarven identity stretches far deeper, rooted in tightly-knit clans bound by shared ancestry and ancient traditions. Each clan specializes in a particular craft or area of expertise - some excel in gem-cutting, others in rune-carving, and still others in the construction of intricate tunnel systems.  Clan elders, keepers of ancestral lore and vital crafting secrets, wield considerable influence within the community.

Children are taught from a young age about their clan’s history and their responsibilities to preserve its knowledge and uphold its reputation. Storytelling, particularly recounting the deeds of past ancestors, is a revered practice, ensuring that valuable lessons and crafting techniques are passed down through generations. It is considered a grave dishonor to forget or misrepresent clan history.

## The Art of Runecarving and Enchantment

Runecarving is not merely a decorative art for dwarves; it’s a potent form of magical enchantment deeply interwoven with their crafting processes. Dwarven artisans pour their very essence and skill into each rune, imbuing their creations with specific properties. Weapons might be inscribed with runes of strength and durability, armor with runes of protection, and tools with runes of precision and efficiency. 

The most skilled runecarvers, known as Rune Masters, hold positions of great respect and are often sought after by the [Council of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/council-of-or.md) for their expertise. It’s said that a Rune Master's work can enhance the power of even the most basic item, transforming it into something extraordinary.  The knowledge of ancient runes and their meanings is a closely guarded secret, passed down within select families.

## Dwarven Values: Honor, Duty, and Craftsmanship

Several core values shape dwarven behavior and social interactions:

*   **Honor:** Above all else, dwarves value honor and integrity. Keeping one's word, upholding one’s reputation, and defending one’s clan are paramount. Dishonorable conduct is met with swift and harsh consequences.
*   **Duty:** Dwarves feel a strong sense of duty to their clan, their community, and the continuation of their traditions. Contributing to the clan's prosperity and safeguarding its future is a primary obligation.
*   **[Craftsmanship](/raw/20250501/craftsmanship/craftsmanship.md):**  Dwarven pride lies in their skill and dedication to their craft. Fine workmanship and attention to detail are considered virtues, and a craftsman's reputation is inextricably linked to the quality of their creations. A shoddy piece of work is a stain upon the entire clan.
