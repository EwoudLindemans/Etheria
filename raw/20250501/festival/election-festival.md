The [Election Festival](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/election-festival.md) is the most vibrant and contentious period in the [calendar](/structure/chronological/calendar.md) of Or. Held every three years, it marks the selection of the five elected representatives who sit on the [Council of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/council-of-or.md) alongside the twelve permanent Flatstone seats. More than just a political event, it’s a city-wide celebration of civic engagement, dwarven ingenuity, and boisterous competition.

## The Run-Up and Competitions

The lead-up to the [Election Festival](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/election-festival.md) is characterized by intense campaigning. Potential candidates, often representing guilds, specific mining districts, or even ideological factions, vie for the public’s favour. Public forums, elaborate street performances, and sponsored feasts are commonplace. However, the real spectacle lies in the official and unofficial competitions. 

**The Stone-Shaping Challenge:** This event tests the candidates’ engineering prowess. Each candidate designs and constructs a miniature structure out of newly mined stone within a set time limit. Judges, consisting of seasoned dwarven architects and engineers, evaluate the designs based on structural integrity, aesthetics, and innovation. Often, candidates employ subtle enchantments to bolster their creations, adding another layer of complexity and intrigue.

**The Debate Gauntlet:** A series of formal debates where candidates argue for their platforms and answer probing questions from the public. Known for its aggressive questioning and occasional outbursts, the Debate Gauntlet is a true test of a candidate's temperament and quick thinking.

**The Tavern Trials:** A series of drinking contests, riddles, and feats of strength held in the city's taverns. Less formal than the other events, the Tavern Trials are a chance for candidates to show their camaraderie and connect with the common folk. They often attract boisterous crowds and result in legendary tales of spilled ale and unexpected displays of skill.

## The Festival Day

Festival Day itself is a riot of colour and sound. Processions wind through the city, led by marching bands and representatives of each candidate. Street vendors hawk their wares, while bards sing rousing ballads. The culmination of the day is the Vote Casting Ceremony, held in the Grand Hall of the Council.  

Each citizen of legal age casts a single stone – a smooth, grey granite pebble – into designated urns for their preferred candidates. The stones are then meticulously counted, and the five candidates with the most votes are declared the new elected representatives.

## Traditions and Superstitions

*   **The Stone Blessing:** It's customary to have your voting stone blessed by a Shrinekeeper before casting it. Many believe this ensures a fair and just outcome. 
*   **The Granite Dust Ritual:**  A small amount of granite dust is sprinkled over the voting area, said to ward off mischievous spirits who might influence the votes. 
*   **The Evening Fireworks Display:** Following the announcement of the new representatives, a spectacular fireworks display illuminates the sky, celebrating the democratic process and promising a new era for Or.
