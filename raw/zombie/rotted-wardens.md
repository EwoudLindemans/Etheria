# Rotting Wardens: The Echoes of Broken Oaths

## Origin and Nature

Rotting Wardens are a peculiar and unsettling phenomenon unique to the lands surrounding the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md). Unlike typical undead, they aren't reanimated corpses driven by mindless hunger. They retain fragments of their former identities, trapped in a looping cycle of duty and despair, bound to the land through the residual [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) interwoven with the [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) itself. Most, though not all, were sworn protectors of the area before the plate fractured, men and women dedicated to maintaining order and guarding against threats – guards, monks, even town officials.

Legend speaks of a ritual performed centuries ago, intended to permanently safeguard the region. A powerful enchantment was woven, imbuing the chosen protectors with unwavering loyalty and the ability to defend their territory against any foe. However, the fracturing of the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md), a cataclysmic event that warped the surrounding landscape and permeated it with erratic magical energies, corrupted this ritual. Instead of eternal guardianship, it created a twisted parody: Rotting Wardens, forever tethered to the land, endlessly repeating their forgotten duties, even as their bodies decay and their minds unravel.

## Appearance and Abilities

Visually, Rotting Wardens are horrifying. Their flesh is perpetually decaying, clinging to bone in patches, riddled with fungal growths, and perpetually slick with unnatural moisture. They wear tattered remnants of their former uniforms or robes, often bearing faded insignias or symbols of their past affiliations. One distinguishing feature is the faint, ethereal glow emanating from their eyes – a residual effect of the enchantment that binds them. While visually frail, they possess surprising resilience. The residual [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) grants them increased durability, making them resistant to mundane weapons. They move with a slow, deliberate pace, exhibiting an almost trance-like state.

Beyond their increased durability, Rotting Wardens retain limited echoes of their former skills. A former soldier might still raise a corroded sword and attempt a basic parry, while a former medic might futilely attempt to mend injuries with rotted bandages. However, these actions are clumsy and ineffective, a sad imitation of their former proficiency. Their most disturbing ability, however, is their ‘Echoing Call.’ When threatened or sensing a potential disruption to their designated area, they emit a low, mournful wail - a fragmented echo of oaths sworn long ago.  This call doesn't inflict physical damage but carries a wave of overwhelming sadness and despair that can unsettle the minds of those who hear it. Witnesses report a sudden, intense feeling of regret and futility, often accompanied by vivid flashbacks of their own failures and losses.

## Connection to Existing Lore

The existence of Rotting Wardens directly ties into the lore of the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md) and the [Cult of Dy](/structure/society/factions/cult-of-dy.md).  Some scholars theorize that the fracturing of the plate disrupted the magical energies crucial to the warding ritual, while others believe the echoes of Dy's [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) (the random rolling of fate) played a cruel hand, twisting a protective measure into a perpetual torment. The Cult of Dy, in particular, studies the Wardens, fascinated by their embodiment of broken oaths and the inherent randomness of existence.  They even attempt to commune with the Wardens, hoping to glean insight into the nature of fate, although with minimal success.  The fact that Wardens retain fragments of their identities and past training suggests their existence goes beyond simple mindless animation, potentially connecting them to the fractured remnants of the world’s forgotten power.

## Notable Wardens

* **Elder Alaron:** A former town magistrate, perpetually attempting to impose order in a village long abandoned, scolding phantom citizens and issuing nonsensical decrees.
* **Ser Kaelen:** A Rotting Warden who still carries a shield emblazoned with the crest of a fallen knightly order, mindlessly defending a ruined bridge against nonexistent threats.
* **Sister Lyra:** A Rotting Warden who once served as a healer, now desperately attempting to apply rotted bandages on passersby, muttering fragmented prayers and lamenting a lost faith.
