# Echoes of Consumption: The Shimmerblight Zombies

## Origins in the Resonance Decay

The shambling horrors known as Shimmerblight Zombies are a relatively recent phenomenon in [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md), appearing with increasing frequency since the [Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) Decay began accelerating. Unlike the mindless undead of other worlds, these beings are a horrifying consequence of the planet's dwindling [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) and the parasitic influence of the [Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) ecosystem’s response – the *Luminscourge*.

The initial outbreak occurred near the shattered remnants of the Veiled Canticle’s central archive. It’s theorized that corrupted [Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md), leaking from damaged [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) and amplifying the Luminscourge's effects on the local flora and fauna, birthed the first ‘Echoes’ – beings driven by a desperate, agonizing desire to reabsorb lost [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md). Early reports described victims as suffering from ‘Resonance Sickness’ – a gradual dimming of their personal aura, followed by fits of aggression and an uncontrollable urge to touch and consume Scales, raw essence, and even other living beings. As their own Resonance continued to drain, they began to physically warp, their bodies becoming translucent and shimmering with an unsettling internal light – the telltale sign of a Shimmerblight Zombie.

## The Luminscourge Connection

The Luminscourge is not a single organism, but a complex network of symbiotic fungal and bioluminescent plant life deeply embedded within [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md)'s ecosystem. As [Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) fades, the Luminscourge grows stronger, its tendrils extending into all aspects of the environment. It releases microscopic spores, known as *[Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Parasites*, that latch onto living creatures. These parasites don’t immediately transform their hosts, but lay dormant, feeding on their Resonance and subtly influencing their behavior.

When [Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) levels drop critically low – a state increasingly common – the parasites activate. They flood the host’s nervous system, overriding their free will and driving them towards the nearest source of [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md). Simultaneously, the parasitic fungi begin to consume the host’s tissue, reweaving it into a semi-sentient husk – a Shimmerblight Zombie. The internal shimmering is due to the Luminscourge's bioluminescence spreading through the parasite-infested tissues. 

## Characteristics and Behavior

*   **Appearance:** Shimmerblight Zombies are gaunt and translucent, their flesh revealing a network of glowing fungal threads. Their eyes are milky white and devoid of any recognition. The intensity of their shimmer correlates with the amount of [Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) they’ve recently consumed.
*   **Movement:** Their movements are jerky and unnatural, a combination of decaying muscles and the parasitic tendrils pulling them forward. They often shamble forward, but can lunge with surprising speed when sensing nearby [Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md).
*   **Feeding Habits:** They don't simply “eat” flesh. They crave [Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md). They will attempt to drain [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) directly from [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md), essence reservoirs, and even living creatures. Contact with a Shimmerblight Zombie can weaken a person's aura, leaving them vulnerable to further attacks.
*   **Weaknesses:** Their primary weakness is the disruption of [Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) flows. Sonic weaponry calibrated to specific frequencies can shatter the parasitic fungal network. Conversely, areas saturated with amplified [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) can temporarily stun them, though the effect is short-lived.

## Unique Variants

*   **[Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) Leech:** Larger, more powerful zombies that have consumed significant amounts of [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md). Their shimmer is intensely bright, and they can emit a wave of draining energy, further weakening nearby creatures.
*   **[Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-Bound Echoes:** Rare variants that have become permanently fused with a piece of a Scale. This grants them enhanced durability and a limited ability to manipulate [Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md), but also anchors them to a specific location.
*   **Spore-Carriers:** Newly transformed zombies that are heavily laden with [Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) Parasites. Their bodies are often covered in a shimmering fungal bloom, making them extremely dangerous to approach.

## Impact on Iridian Society

The emergence of Shimmerblight Zombies has further destabilized [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md), straining resources and exacerbating tensions between factions. The Followers of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md) see them as a sign of the planet’s impending doom, while the Scalebreakers are eager to weaponize their parasitic nature. The Merchants Guild has begun to trade in rare fungal extracts harvested from the zombies, further blurring the line between survival and exploitation.
