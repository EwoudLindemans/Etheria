# The Crimson Forge

## A Bastion of Steel and Flame within Arkona

Nestled within the heavily fortified district of Lower [Arkona](/generated/city/arkona.md), dwarfed by the imposing architecture surrounding it, stands the Crimson Forge. It isn’t a sprawling complex like one might expect from a city as powerful as [Arkona](/geography/settlement/city/arkona.md), but rather a dense, multi-layered structure carved directly into the bedrock. The name is derived from the perpetually glowing, crimson-hued metal slag constantly expelled from its depths – a signature byproduct of its unique refining processes.

## Mastery of Scale-Forged Steel

The Crimson Forge isn’t merely a blacksmith shop; it's the sole producer of [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-Forged Steel within [Arkona](/generated/city/arkona.md), and arguably the most skilled in all of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md). Scale-Forged Steel derives its exceptional durability and heat resistance from the careful infusion of minute scale fragments – remnants of ancient, colossal creatures theorized to have roamed the land long before recorded history. These scales are extremely rare and highly sought after, making Scale-Forged Steel incredibly expensive, and consequently, a symbol of considerable status and wealth. Only the elite guard of [Arkona](/geography/settlement/city/arkona.md), the wealthy merchant families, and Lady Arkona herself utilize weaponry and armor made from this coveted material.

## Master Forgemaster Volkov

The forge is managed and operated by the renowned Master Forgemaster Volkov, a gruff and secretive dwarf whose reputation precedes him. Volkov is rumored to be of ancient lineage, possessing knowledge passed down through generations, allowing him to extract and integrate the [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) fragments with unparalleled precision. He is a master of the forge, capable of crafting weapons and armor of legendary quality.  However, he takes on few commissions outside of those directly authorized by Lady [Arkona](/generated/city/arkona.md), known for his disdain of frivolous requests and a fiercely guarded proprietary process.

Volkov’s forge operates on a strict hierarchy. Lesser dwarven smiths, tirelessly working under his guidance, prepare the base metals and manage the intensive heating process.  Human apprentices, rigorously vetted for their aptitude and unwavering loyalty, assist in the intricate [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) infusion and final shaping. A small but dedicated team of dwarven engineers maintains the massive, rune-powered furnaces that keep the forge operational – a crucial task given the constant demands for power.

## Connection to Gorgraths Wrath

Rumors swirl within [Arkona](/generated/city/arkona.md)'s underbelly, whispering of a clandestine connection between the Crimson Forge and Gorgraths Wrath, the secret organization plotting to undermine the Flatstone dynasty. It’s suggested that certain specialized alloys, subtly altered from the standard [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-forged composition, are being discreetly produced for the organization's agents. It's believed these
