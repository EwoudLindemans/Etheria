# Krosh the Scavenger

## Background & Appearance

Krosh is a relatively young, but seasoned, hobgoblin known throughout the crumbling ruins near [Arkona](/generated/city/arkona.md) for his uncanny ability to locate discarded and often dangerous artifacts. Unlike many of his kind who revel in raiding and blatant aggression, Krosh displays a peculiar fascination with forgotten technologies and remnants of a bygone era – a habit that has earned him a reputation as both a skilled scavenger and a bit of an oddity amongst the broader hobgoblin population.

Physically, Krosh is unremarkable for a hobgoblin. Standing a little taller than average (around 7’2”), he's wiry rather than brutishly strong.  His skin is a mottled grey-green, typical of his lineage, but covered in countless small scars and burn marks - evidence of his profession. He favors scavenged armor pieces and layered clothing, a mismatched collection of leather, metal, and fabric, clearly chosen for function over appearance. One notable feature is a crudely fashioned pair of goggles, made from polished gemstones and repurposed metal wires, that he wears perpetually, allowing him to discern details in low light and occasionally filter out dust. His weaponry consists primarily of a heavily modified shortbow strung with spider silk and a collection of repurposed tools fashioned into makeshift bludgeons and traps.

## Connection to Arkona and the Arcane Fangs

Krosh's scavenging efforts are primarily focused on the areas surrounding [Arkona](/generated/city/arkona.md), drawn by the city’s long history of arcane experimentation and its position as a nexus of the magical [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md). He’s particularly interested in remnants of the early experiments related to refining magical power from the scales, believing that unlocking these forgotten techniques holds the key to a more sustainable and efficient means of harnessing that power. This fascination has inadvertently brought him into contact with members of the **[Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md)**, the organization dedicated to exploiting the magical scales. While Krosh doesn't outwardly support the Fangs' goals of widespread access (and potential misuse) of the scales, he occasionally trades recovered artifacts to certain factions within the group in exchange for information about forgotten technologies. He justifies this by rationalizing that knowledge, even dangerous knowledge, is preferable to ignorance. It’s a delicate balancing act that keeps him constantly looking over his shoulder.

## Relationship with the Followers of Irion

Krosh is acutely aware of the **Followers of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)**’s protective stance over Batès Lamina and the spiritual significance they assign to the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md). He’s learned to avoid direct interaction with them, understanding that their zealotry makes them unpredictable and potentially hostile to anyone perceived as interfering with their sacred duty. He has, however, observed their rituals from afar, occasionally noting their use of seemingly outdated techniques for detecting fluctuations in the scales' magical signature. He suspects that these techniques might hold valuable insights and he occasionally attempts to glean information during covert observations.

## Personality & Motivations

Krosh is not a naturally sociable individual. Years of solitary scavenging have made him wary and introspective. He’s not cruel or malicious, but driven by an insatiable curiosity and a practical desire to survive in a dangerous world.  He speaks sparingly, preferring to observe and analyze before acting. Despite his reclusive nature, Krosh harbors a secret ambition: to create a repository of forgotten knowledge, a “Library of Relics,” where all the secrets of the past can be preserved and studied, a stark contrast to the [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md) desire for personal power and access. This ambition keeps him driven and focused despite the risks involved in his scavenging work.

## Potential Hooks

*   The PCs discover Krosh attempting to decipher an ancient schematic related to a [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md)-refining device, potentially drawing unwanted attention from the [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md).
*   Krosh possesses a key fragment needed to unlock a forgotten cache of technology sought by both the Followers of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md) and the [Cult of Dy](/structure/society/factions/cult-of-dy.md), placing the PCs in a conflict between these factions.
*   Krosh has unwittingly recovered a dangerous artifact connected to [The Dense](/generated/the-dense/the-dense.md), needing assistance from the PCs to understand its function and potential threat before the Gorgraths Wrath gets wind of it.
