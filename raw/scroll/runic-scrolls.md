# Runic Scrolls of Aethelgard

Runic scrolls are not merely vessels for written words within Aethelgard; they are conduits for bound elemental energy, painstakingly crafted by specialized artisans known as **Rune-Weavers**. Unlike simple parchment scrolls, these artifacts are made from a peculiar, petrified fungus found exclusively within the Obsidian Caverns beneath Mount Cinderpeak. This fungus, when properly prepared and imbued with elemental binding runes, retains an unnervingly stable form, able to withstand extreme conditions and retain magical potency for centuries.

## The Crafting Process

The creation of a runic scroll is a lengthy and dangerous undertaking, requiring years of dedicated training and access to rare materials. The process is divided into several stages:

*   **Fungal Harvesting & Preparation:** The fungus must be harvested during specific lunar cycles to ensure optimal energy retention. The raw material is then carefully dried and treated with alchemical solvents to remove impurities and prepare it for rune inscription.
*   **Rune-Weaving:** This is the most demanding stage, performed by skilled Rune-Weavers who use specialized tools made from star-iron to etch intricate runes onto the fungal surface. The runes are not simply decorative; they are complex geometrical patterns that channel elemental energies. Each rune corresponds to a specific element (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Aether) and a particular effect. Master Rune-Weavers can combine multiple runes to create incredibly complex and powerful scrolls.
*   **Elemental Binding:** Once the runes are inscribed, the scroll must be bound to the desired elemental energy through a ritual involving rare crystals and precisely calibrated incantations. A poorly executed binding can result in a volatile scroll prone to unpredictable magical surges.

## Types of Runic Scrolls

Runic scrolls come in a vast array of forms, each tailored to a specific purpose. Some common examples include:

*   **Spark Scrolls:** Small, fire-infused scrolls used to ignite torches or create small bursts of flame. Often used by miners and explorers.
*   **Torrent Scrolls:** Water-bound scrolls capable of creating streams of water, often used for irrigation or defense.
*   **Stoneform Scrolls:** Earth-infused scrolls used to reinforce structures or create temporary barriers. Preferred by dwarven engineers.
*   **Whisperwind Scrolls:** Air-bound scrolls capable of carrying messages across long distances, favored by scouts and messengers.
*   **Aetherglow Scrolls:** Rare and exceptionally powerful scrolls imbued with the elusive Aether, capable of manipulating the very fabric of magical energy. These are meticulously guarded by the Arcanum of Veritas.

## Scroll Degradation and Restoral

Despite their durability, runic scrolls are not immune to degradation. Repeated use or exposure to extreme conditions can weaken the runes, diminishing their potency. A skilled Rune-Restorer can repair damaged scrolls, although the process is delicate and requires substantial skill and resources. Completely destroyed scrolls are irretrievable, representing a significant loss of magical power and knowledge. Notably, attempts to forge runic scrolls are often met with disastrous results, as the volatile energy within the fungal material can unleash uncontrolled magical surges.

## Historical Significance

Runic scrolls played a vital role in the ancient wars of Aethelgard, used to power siege weaponry, bolster fortifications, and unleash devastating magical attacks. The gradual decline of Rune-Weaving knowledge following the Cataclysm has made authentic runic scrolls increasingly rare and valuable artifacts, prized by collectors, mages, and powerful organizations alike.
