# Scroll Crafting in Or

Within the structured societies of Or, scrolls are more than mere records; they are potent conduits of magical energy, painstakingly crafted and imbued with purpose. Their creation and usage are governed by strict tradition and overseen by the Scribes' Guild, a revered institution within Or's academic circles.

## Materials & Construction

The foundation of any scroll begins with **Vellumwood**, a rare bark harvested from ancient, magically resonant trees found within the depths of [Triz Valley](/geography/settlement/city/triz-valley.md). Each sheet undergoes a ritual cleansing by Scribes to purify it and prepare it to receive magical inscription. The quality of the Vellumwood directly impacts the scroll’s overall power and durability.

Once the Vellumwood is prepared, the inscription begins. This isn't simply writing; it's a precise, geometrically precise process employing specially prepared **Ink-Stones**. These stones, ground to fine powders and mixed with shimmering dust gathered from Veilsteel shavings, come in a spectrum of colours, each corresponding to a different school of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and power level:

*   **Obsidian Black:** Necromancy and Shadow Weaving – volatile and difficult to control.
*   **Azure Blue:** Illusion and Transmutation – requires immense focus and precision.
*   **Veridian Green:** Restoration and Nature [Magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) – most common, used in healing and warding.
*   **Crimson Red:** Evocation and Destruction – dangerous to craft and handle.

The inks are applied using **Glyph Pens**, crafted from polished bone and imbued with a faint [resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md). These pens must be ritually blessed before use. The precise arrangement of runes, symbols, and geometric patterns, known as **Weaves**, are paramount. Incorrectly drawn Weaves can lead to unpredictable and disastrous results.

## Types of Scrolls

Scrolls are classified based on their purpose and power level, designated by a tiered system:

*   **Cadence Scrolls (Tier I):** Simple effects, like light manipulation, minor repairs, or basic detection spells. Commonly used by apprentices and scouts.
*   **[Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) Scrolls (Tier II):** More complex and potent spells, such as moderate healing, illusory disguises, or short-range teleportation. The primary tools of skilled mages and vigilantes.
*   **Chordant Scrolls (Tier III):** Powerful and rare, these scrolls can unleash devastating attacks, manipulate the environment, or conjure powerful guardians. Reserved for the Order’s most experienced mages and used sparingly.
*   **Capstone Scrolls (Tier IV):** Legendary scrolls rumored to hold the essence of ancient powers, said to be able to reshape reality or bind powerful entities. Their existence is debated among scholars, and their recovery would be a momentous event.

## Scroll Augmentation & Preservation

Once crafted, scrolls can be further augmented with **Memory Shards**, slivers of solidified magical energy scavenged from Veilsteel remnants, increasing their power or adding secondary effects.  Careful preservation is also crucial.  Scrolls are typically stored in **[Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) Cases**, lined with Vellumwood and treated with special preservatives to prevent fading and degradation.

## Scribes’ Guild & Regulations

The Scribes’ Guild maintains a strict monopoly on scroll creation and regulation. Unauthorized crafting is a serious offense punishable by exile. The Guild also meticulously catalogs all created scrolls, ensuring their potency and preventing misuse. They hold detailed records of Weaves, ingredients, and augmentation techniques, guarding these secrets jealously.

## Recent Developments

The recent surge in demand for Veilsteel alloys has led to a shortage of Memory Shards, impacting scroll augmentation. Furthermore, rumors persist of rogue factions attempting to replicate Scribes’ Guild techniques to create unauthorized scrolls, threatening the stability of magical practices within Or. The Guild is currently focused on securing Memory Shard sources and cracking down on illicit scroll crafting.
