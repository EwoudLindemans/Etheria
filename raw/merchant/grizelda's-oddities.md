# Grizelda's Oddities

![grizeldas-oddities.png](/world/grizeldas-oddities.png =400x)

Grizelda’s Oddities isn't merely a merchant—it's a *phenomenon*. Found nestled in a perpetually shifting corner of [Gutterbrew Alley](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/district/gutterbrew-alley.md) (typically near [the Inkblot Bindery](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-inkblot-bindery.md), but sometimes appearing where the alley intersects with forgotten dream-paths), Grizelda's is a repository for the… *unusual*. It is the place you go when you need something you didn't know existed, or need to get rid of something that should never have been created.

## The Proprietor: Grizelda

Grizelda herself is a study in contradictions. She appears to be an elderly dwarf, though her beard is braided with iridescent feathers and her eyes hold a disconcerting sparkle that belies her apparent age. She is constantly enveloped in a swirling aura of scents—burnt sugar, ozone, stale tea, and something indescribably *ancient*. Conversations with her are… taxing. She speaks in riddles, offers cryptic advice, and frequently pauses to murmur to unseen entities.

No one knows where she comes from. Some say she’s a refugee from a lost dwarven city built within a dying star. Others claim she’s a wandering djinn, trapped in the form of a dwarf as punishment for a forgotten bargain. Grizelda herself offers no explanation, simply stating, “The tides bring what they will. And I keep the shore.”

## Inventory: Beyond Comprehension

Describing Grizelda's stock is a fool’s errand. It changes with the phase of the moon, the whims of the city's collective dreams, and occasionally, a sudden gust of wind. One day, you might find vials of captured echoes, capable of replaying forgotten conversations. The next, a map that leads not to a place, but to a *feeling*. Recent additions include:

*   **Bottled Starlight (Genuine):** For illumination or summoning moth-like familiars (use with caution).
*   **Chromatic Gears:** Said to regulate emotions. Side effects may include uncontrollable weeping or spontaneous bursts of poetry.
*   **Pocket Dimensions (Slightly Used):** Perfect for storing valuables or hiding from aggressive tax collectors. (Warning: May contain residual echoes of previous occupants).
*   **The Unwritten Scroll:** A blank parchment that seemingly attracts stories. It’s said to grow longer and more detailed as you narrate events around it. (Do *not* read aloud.)
*   **Dream Weavers:** Threads spun from solidified dreams, capable of subtly altering the course of events.

## Pricing and Payment

Grizelda doesn't deal in standard currency. She prefers… *barter*.  Services, memories, emotions, promises, and forgotten secrets are all accepted forms of payment.  Be warned: she has a discerning eye for value, and will not be easily fooled.  Attempting to haggle is generally met with a withering stare and a lecture on the delicate balance of existence.

## Reputation and Rumors

*   **The City Watch:** “She’s harmless. Mostly. Just don’t ask where she gets her goods.”
*   **[The Inkblot Bindery](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-inkblot-bindery.md):** “Grizelda's is the logical extension of the chaos we contain. She simply deals in the *results*.”
*   **The Concord:**
