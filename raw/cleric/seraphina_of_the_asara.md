# Seraphina of the Asara

## Background

Seraphina is a relatively young cleric, barely past her thirtieth year, yet she carries herself with a solemnity far beyond her age. She is a devout follower of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md), though her approach is less about ecstatic communion and more about meticulous preservation and careful study of the mystical power resonating from the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md). Born in a small village nestled near the edges of the roads that run beneath the colossal blue expanse, Seraphina grew up hearing the legends of the Plate’s protective influence, and the strange phenomenon of the shifting crystal formations that adorned its surface. Initially, she was drawn to the Plate’s aesthetic beauty, but a childhood encounter with a band of [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md) attempting to harvest the crystals sparked a profound sense of purpose within her.

Having observed their callous disregard for the sanctity of the Plate and the potential disruption of its protective energies, she dedicated herself to understanding and safeguarding this vital nexus of power. She sought out training from older clerics within a small order known as the Guardians of Reflection, who focused on shielding the surrounding settlements from wild magical surges emanating from the [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) and researching the nature of the crystalline patterns.  Her superiors noted Seraphina's exceptional ability to sense subtle shifts in the Plate's magical [resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) – a talent considered essential for preventing destabilization and guiding protective wards.

## Beliefs and Practices

Seraphina sees [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md) not as a [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md) to be worshipped through emotional displays, but as a fading echo – a residue of immense magical power imprinted onto the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md), slowly dissipating across [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md). She believes the primary duty of the faithful is to *preserve* this legacy, safeguarding the scales from exploitation and understanding the principles governing their magical properties. Her prayers are focused on attuning to the plate’s [resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) and actively stabilizing the crystal formations. She favors quiet meditation amongst the formations, cataloging and analysing their patterns rather than loudly praising Irion's greatness.  She is incredibly wary of those who seek to actively extract power from the scales, believing that doing so inevitably weakens Irion's imprint and could accelerate the loss of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) across Iridia.

While acknowledging the importance of healing and protection, Seraphina prioritizes safeguarding the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md). She tends to be pragmatic and less inclined to undertake risky endeavors that could jeopardize her ability to fulfill this duty. Her healing abilities, though present, are more focused on repairing magical damage caused by unstable energies, rather than curing mundane ailments.

## Equipment & Abilities

*   **Asara's Radiance:** A silver amulet inlaid with a fragment of crystalline material harvested ethically from a naturally shed piece of the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md). It allows her to sense fluctuations in the plate's energy and subtly amplify her healing abilities, specifically targeting magical maladies. It also grants a slight resistance to magical surges.
*   **Focus of Reflection:** A polished obsidian mirror used to focus and direct her prayers, creating protective wards and bolstering her detection abilities.
*   **Crystalline Primer:** A leather-bound journal meticulously detailing her observations of the crystal formations on the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md), including diagrams, patterns, and notes on their energetic properties.
*   **Minor Healing:** Able to mend minor wounds and cure ailments. Specializes in counteracting magical disruptions.
*   **Sense [Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md):** Able to detect shifts in the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md)’s energetic field, enabling her to anticipate disruptions and guide protective measures.
*   **Ward Creation:** Able to create temporary wards using prayer and the Focus of Reflection, providing limited protection against magical attacks.

## Connections

*   **Guardians of Reflection:** Her order, comprised of individuals dedicated to safeguarding the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md) and studying its properties. She is a rising figure within the order.
*   **Villagers of Oakhaven:** The small village nestled near the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md), which she quietly protects from magical anomalies. She provides guidance and subtle assistance to the villagers, though she avoids direct involvement in their daily affairs.
