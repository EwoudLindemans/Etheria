# Whispers of the Unborn Gate

## A Rumor from the Arcane Fangs

For decades, the [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md) have spread tales of immense power residing within the *Dense*, a realm whispered to exist beyond the rifts born from the cracks in the continents. While most dismiss these stories as fanciful exaggerations designed to lure recruits, a particularly persistent rumor has begun to circulate amongst their inner circles – the existence of the *Unborn Gate*. 

According to this rumor, the Unborn Gate isn’t just another pathway into the *Dense*, but a nexus point, a fractured echo of the original source from which the *Dense* itself sprung. Legends say that before the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) formed – before [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md), before the land even took shape – there was an embryonic realm of pure, formless potential. The Unborn Gate is theorized to be a weakened conduit to this primal void, a place where the raw stuff of creation still lingers. 

The rumor is fueled by cryptic findings from recent, and often failed, expeditions into the *Dense*. Several Fangs operatives have returned raving about glimpses of *impossible landscapes* and echoes of *voices that weren’t voices*, whispering promises of power beyond comprehension. One particularly desperate operative, on the verge of madness, claimed to have witnessed a “city of shadows,” its architecture shifting and reforming constantly as if struggling to solidify into existence. 

Of course, finding the Unborn Gate is far from simple. The rumor specifies that it only manifests under incredibly specific conditions: during the convergence of three celestial events - the alignment of the [Ornite Ring](/geography/scale/ornite-ring.md), a rare eclipse known as the Shadow’s Kiss, and a phenomenon where the reflected light from the [Asara Plate](/geography/scale/asara-plate.md) aligns with the north star. Should these conditions be met, it is claimed that a shimmering, almost invisible rift will briefly appear somewhere within the *[Mountains of Triz](/geography/region/mountains-of-triz.md)*, close to the location known as the “Empty Peak”.

The potential rewards are staggering. Should the Gate be accessed, some believe it will provide a route to power and resources far beyond anything currently imaginable. Others fear its potential consequences; the possibility of unleashing a wave of chaos or even a primal force capable of unraveling [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) itself.  The potential danger has certainly not deterred the more ambitious amongst the [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md), who are now actively seeking out those who can predict the next convergence with a high degree of accuracy.
