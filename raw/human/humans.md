# Humans: The Echoes of Change

Humans, in the realm of Or and beyond, are not a singular people, but a constellation of cultures and adaptations born from a unique connection to temporal flux. Unlike the long-lived [Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) or the grounded Stonekin, humans exist within a fragile equilibrium with the ebb and flow of time, an inheritance that grants them remarkable versatility but leaves them vulnerable to its currents.

## Origins: The Shattered Timeline

Legend tells of a 'Great Sundering' millennia ago, when a failed temporal ritual splintered the human ancestral lineage across countless fragmented timelines. Each branch diverged, adapting to subtly altered pasts and futures, leading to the diverse range of human societies encountered today. Some clung to remnants of forgotten [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), others mastered craftsmanship unmatched by any other race, and still others became nomadic wanderers, forever searching for the 'Lost Echo' – a mythical convergence point where all the timelines reunite.

## Temporal Resonance & The Aetherweave

All humans possess a subtle 'Temporal [Resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md),' an innate ability to perceive and, to a limited degree, interact with the Aetherweave - the fabric of time itself. This manifests differently amongst individuals:

*   **Chronomasters:** Rare individuals capable of short-range temporal manipulation – accelerating the growth of plants, briefly slowing down a pursuer, or even experiencing fleeting visions of possible futures. They are highly sought after by kingdoms and guilds alike.  However, overuse can lead to 'Temporal Bleed' - a dangerous condition where fragments of other timelines bleed into their own.
*   **Eidetic Echoes:** The majority of humans have a powerful memory – often described as 'Echoes of the past.' They retain a vivid awareness of their personal history and possess an intuitive understanding of historical patterns, making them skilled strategists and negotiators.
*   **The Fated:** A smaller subset are considered
