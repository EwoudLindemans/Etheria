# The Scriptor's Guild: Keepers of the Written Word

The Scriptor's Guild stands as the foremost organization dedicated to the preservation, creation, and interpretation of written knowledge within the [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md) and beyond. While [Stonfin Dustbinder](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/runehollow-hall/stonfin-dustbinder.md) serves as the primary caretaker of [Runehollow Hall](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/runehollow-hall.md), the Guild encompasses a wider network of scribes, illuminators, translators, and lorekeepers, all bound by a shared reverence for the power of the written word.

## Membership and Ranks

Membership in the Scriptor’s Guild isn’t easily earned. Potential recruits undergo rigorous testing, proving their literacy, calligraphy skills, knowledge of ancient languages (Dwarvish, Elvish, and the Common Tongue being essential), and a demonstrable respect for the sanctity of knowledge. The Guild is structured in a hierarchical system:

*   **Apprentice:** Trainees under the direct supervision of a Senior Scribe. Apprentices typically spend five to ten years learning the basics of inscription, translation, and the history of the Guild.
*   **Scribe:** Fully-fledged members capable of independent work. Scribes are entrusted with tasks such as copying manuscripts, translating ancient texts, and cataloguing new acquisitions.
*   **Illuminator:** Specializing in the creation of intricate and beautiful illustrations and ornamentation for manuscripts. Guild Illuminators are renowned for their skill in blending artistry with knowledge, enhancing texts with visual splendor.
*   **Lorekeeper:** The highest rank within the Guild, Lorekeepers are scholars and researchers dedicated to uncovering lost knowledge, interpreting ambiguous texts, and advising the city council on matters of history and ancient lore.

## Guild Activities and Responsibilities

Beyond their duties within [Runehollow Hall](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/runehollow-hall.md), the Scriptor’s Guild performs several vital functions:

*   **Manuscript Reproduction:** They are responsible for creating accurate copies of rare and fragile texts, ensuring knowledge isn’t lost to the ravages of time.
*   **Linguistic Preservation:** The Guild actively works to preserve dying languages, transcribing oral traditions and documenting dialects before they disappear entirely. This is particularly important with the fragmented histories of surface-dwelling cultures.
*   **Decipherment of Runes and Symbols:** Their expertise in ancient languages and systems of writing allows them to decipher newly discovered runes and symbols, sometimes revealing secrets that could reshape the city's understanding of its past.
*   **Record-Keeping for the Council:** The Guild maintains meticulous records of all official documents and legal proceedings for the City Council, ensuring transparency and accountability.

## Notable Traditions and Artifacts

*   **The Inkstone of Ages:** A legendary inkstone crafted from a single piece of crystallized [Armour of Or](/geography/scale/armour-of-or.md), said to imbue the ink with an almost eternal quality. It’s kept under tight lock and key within the Guild's central archives.
*   **The Silent Vow:**  New members take a Silent Vow upon joining the Guild – a commitment to discretion and the protection of sensitive information. Breaking this vow carries severe consequences, including expulsion from the Guild and potential imprisonment.
*   **Annual Translation Competition:** A prestigious competition held each year to test the skills of the Guild's most talented translators, with the victor awarded a coveted position within the Archives.
