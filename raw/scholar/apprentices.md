# Apprentices of Runehollow

## The First Steps

Becoming a scholar within the [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md) isn't a matter of birthright, but rather a testament to dedication and intellect. The foundation of this pursuit lies in the apprenticeship programs offered by [Runehollow Hall](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/runehollow-hall.md). These aren't mere clerical tasks; they are rigorous training regimens designed to mold aspiring scholars from eager minds into diligent and discerning researchers.

Entry into an apprenticeship is fiercely competitive. Potential candidates, typically teenagers or young adults, must pass a comprehensive examination overseen by a panel of senior scholars. This assessment covers fundamental knowledge of history, languages (including Dwarvish, Common, and the ancient script of the Sky-Miners), basic runes, and a surprisingly demanding aptitude test involving pattern recognition and memory recall. Those deemed worthy are then assigned to a mentor – a seasoned scholar specializing in a particular field of study.

## The Mentor's Guidance

The apprenticeship period itself lasts for seven years, a deliberate homage to the seven levels of [Runehollow Hall](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/runehollow-hall.md). Each year focuses on a specific aspect of scholarship. The first two years are dedicated to the basics: cataloguing, restoration of damaged texts (a task surprisingly common due to the fluctuating humidity and occasional subterranean tremors), and the meticulous copying of important documents. This is not rote memorization, but a practice in precision, observation, and the subtle art of identifying potential errors and inconsistencies.

Years three and four delve into research methodology. Apprentices learn to navigate the vast archives, discern credible sources from unreliable hearsay, and develop the critical thinking skills necessary to evaluate new information. This often involves participation in ongoing research projects under the mentor’s direction – assisting with the decipherment of fragmented scrolls, the comparative analysis of historical accounts, or the meticulous examination of newly discovered artifacts.

During years five and six, apprentices begin to specialize in their chosen field. Some might focus on runelore, studying the principles of magical inscription and the hidden meanings embedded within ancient runes. Others may gravitate towards the study of the Sky-Miners, attempting to reconstruct their forgotten history and uncover the secrets of their celestial explorations. Still others may immerse themselves in the study of engineering, analyzing the blueprints of ancient dwarven structures and attempting to replicate their impressive feats of craftsmanship.
