# Stormwing

## Description & Habitat

The Stormwing ( *Aetherornis tempestii* ) is a colossal avian creature native to the perpetually storm-wracked peaks of the Xaratius continent, particularly within and around the [Mountains of Triz](/geography/region/mountains-of-triz.md). Reaching wingspans of up to eighty feet, they are easily visible even from a considerable distance, often appearing as fleeting shadows against the churning skies. Their plumage is predominantly a dark, slate grey, subtly shifting in hue depending on the angle of the light – a remarkable adaptation allowing them to blend seamlessly with the turbulent weather patterns they inhabit. Iridescent veins of azure and violet shimmer across their feathers, especially prominent around their wingtips, a testament to the potent magical energies that permeate their bodies.

Stormwings are highly territorial creatures, claiming vast swathes of mountain range as their own. They typically nest on sheer cliffsides, building massive structures of woven branches, stone, and reinforced with a secreted, incredibly strong adhesive. These nests, often generations old, become veritable fortresses, defended fiercely against any perceived threat.

## Biology and Abilities

Beyond their sheer size, the Stormwing's most remarkable feature is its intrinsic connection to the elemental forces of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md). They possess an innate ability to manipulate weather patterns, generating powerful gusts of wind, localized lightning storms, and even summoning brief but intense hailstorms. This isn't merely a learned skill, but a fundamental aspect of their physiology; their bodies are conduits for raw magical energy, channeling it through specialized organs located within their wings and chest.

Their diet consists primarily of large, high-altitude prey, such as the Shaggoth - a hardy mountain ungulate - and occasionally, smaller Wyverns foolish enough to venture into their territory. They have razor-sharp talons capable of tearing through even the thickest hides, and a powerful beak designed for crushing bone. Unusually for a flying creature, they are also capable of short bursts of movement on land, though they are far more agile and powerful in the air.

## Connection to Lore and Organisations

Rumours persist that Stormwing nests contain a concentration of raw magical energy, often sought after by the **[Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md)**. These energy nodes are theorised to be areas where the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md)’s fallen god, [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md), have manifested themselves, providing a unique power source. These rumors have lead to conflicts between the Arcane Fangs and the **Gorgraths Wrath**, who see exploitation of the natural order as an act of sacrilege and are determined to protect the Stormwings' habitat. 

Some Scholars theorize that the **[Ornite Ring](/geography/scale/ornite-ring.md)**, a celestial anomaly orbiting [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md), influences Stormwing behavior, drawing them upwards during periods of intense magical flux. It is suggested that the Ring amplifies the creatures’ weather manipulation abilities, making them even more powerful and unpredictable. The **Followers of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)** believe the Stormwings are echoes of his immense power, manifesting as guardians of the remaining magical energies scattered across Iridia. They avoid harming them, considering it a violation of their faith. 

## Notable Individuals

- **Zephyra**, an abnormally intelligent Stormwing, rumoured to have learned to understand a basic form of communication through observing nomadic tribes residing near the [Mountains of Triz](/geography/region/mountains-of-triz.md). She is said to possess a heightened sensitivity to the weather, able to predict storms with uncanny accuracy.
