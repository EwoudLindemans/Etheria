# The Obsidian Pact

## Overview

The Obsidian Pact is a clandestine organization dedicated to the excavation, study, and ultimately, control of the raw magical energies emanating from the rifts and fissures connecting [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) to [The Dense](/generated/the-dense/the-dense.md). Unlike the [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md) who seek to weaponize and profit from this power, the Pact's aims are far more esoteric and long-term, bordering on fanatical. They believe that understanding and mastering these energies is key to not only safeguarding Iridia from incursions from [The Dense](/geography/realm/the-dense.md), but also achieving a form of transcendence, evolving beyond the limitations of mortal existence. The Pact operates from hidden vaults and subterranean laboratories, carefully concealed beneath seemingly unremarkable settlements, often utilizing corrupted or indebted individuals as unwitting accomplices.

## Origins and Ideology

The Pact's genesis lies in the research of the long-lost Order of the Geomancers, a group of scholars who initially charted the initial cracks and fissures opening across the continents as a result of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)’s essence splintering after its death. Dismissed as eccentric dreamers by the broader scholarly community, their meticulous notes and arcane diagrams were rediscovered decades later by a zealous individual named Kaelen Vorlag. Vorlag, disillusioned with the traditional approaches to [Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) – which he viewed as merely manipulating already-existing energies – became convinced that the true power lay in tapping into the raw, unrefined source, directly from the rifts themselves. He gathered a small group of similarly minded individuals and founded the Obsidian Pact, named for the black, glass-like crystalline formations often found around the rifts—formations believed to be solidified echoes of the planar energies.

The Pact’s core ideology is rooted in a distorted interpretation of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)’s legacy. They believe that while the creature's essence is scattered across the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md), true understanding of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) comes not from venerating the fragmented spirit but from dissecting and mastering the power it represents. They see themselves as the inheritors of Irion's potential, destined to forge a new era of magical dominion, even if it requires significant sacrifices and unconventional methods.

## Methods and Operations

The Obsidian Pact employs a hierarchical structure, with the Grand Architect (currently known as Lyra Shadowmere) at the apex, responsible for orchestrating the organization's strategic objectives and overseeing the core research. Beneath the Grand Architect are the Master Excavators, specialized in safely accessing and containing raw planar energies—a precarious and often deadly task. The rank of Rune Scribes are responsible for developing and adapting runes and sigils which helps to harness and direct the energies. The general populous of the Pact are known as Veins, who are responsible for logistics, information gathering and protection. 

The Pact's operations are characterized by extreme secrecy and meticulous planning. They often use deception and manipulation to infiltrate settlements near rifts, subtly influencing local authorities and manipulating events to facilitate their access. They have a reputation for employing ruthless efficiency, willing to eliminate anyone who threatens their progress or exposes their existence. 

**Notable Tactics:**

*   **Rift Stabilization Rituals:** The Pact frequently conducts rituals near rifts, ostensibly to 'stabilize' them, but in reality, these rituals are designed to create localized zones of concentrated planar energy, which the Pact can then harvest.
*   **Veiled Acquisitions:** Utilizing corrupted contacts within various organisations (including the Sisterhood of Assassination), the Pact secretly purchases artifacts and tools potentially useful in planar research, avoiding scrutiny.
*   **Shadow Weavers:** A covert team of “Shadow Weavers” specializes in subtly altering memories and influencing the perceptions of individuals, allowing the Pact to maintain secrecy and control vital informants.

## Connections and Conflicts

*   **Conflict with the [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md):** The Pact views the Arcane Fangs as reckless and short-sighted, concerned only with personal gain at the expense of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md)'s safety. The two organizations are engaged in a clandestine cold war, vying for control of prime rift locations and resources.
*   **Distrust of the Followers of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md):** The Pact openly mocks the [Followers of Irion](/structure/society/factions/followers-of-irion.md) for their reverence of the creature’s scattered essence. They see the followers as naive and misguided, unable to grasp the true potential of planar energy. 
*   **Possible Alliances with Gorgraths Wrath:** Some rumors suggest tenuous alliances between elements within the Pact and Gorgraths Wrath, motivated by a shared interest in undermining the Flatstone dynasty and obtaining resources from the [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md). However, the Pact maintains extreme caution, wary of being exposed through such associations. 
*   **Connection to the [Cult of Dy](/structure/society/factions/cult-of-dy.md):** Both organisations have been observed participating in similar rituals to channel planar energies into tangible results. The full extent of the connection remains obscured.
