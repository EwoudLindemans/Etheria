# The Well

Near the [Momentus Outpost](/momentus-outpost) that lies on the outer edge of [The Desert of the Rendishing Night](/the-desert-of-the-rendishing-night) , there is a recently build Water Well (The Shinging Well).

The well has a weathered look to it. It might be because of the Gale force winds that carries large amount of sand. It is a water source, dug into the ground to offer easy access to fresh drinking water. The area was found because there was a strange wet patch on the ground in the middle of the dunes.

After the build was completed it was used occasionally to retrieve water. But soon enough people stopped returning. The rumours grew that there was some kind of beast waiting at the outer edge of the well. Locals are aware of the dangers. And the quality of live has been greatly reduced because of some shortages on water.

## Runners
Nowadays there are runners that are wellfaring water between the well and the outpost.
These runners are trained heavily in dexterity. After the installation of a specialized unit of these runners the death count has been reduced massivey although people still sometimes dont make it.

## The Invisible Stalker

Extra Planar Shadow Manifested on the prime material plane in a subltile form, impacting it a minor or even hidden way. A collapse of two realms that was slightly intentional. The entrance to the plane is restricted to individuals that have found the entrance by accident.
Inside there is some floating debree, and some gentle currents.

A ancient Intelligent [Invisible Stalker](/monster/invisible-stalker) that is in many ways not the same of its own kind lives here. The monster seems to be waiting for something. It seems to have no trouble finding patches of collapsed planes to travel between.
