# Gorgrath the Brute
An Orcish slave owner. He was the leader of a slavers camp where many dwarves were forced to excavate stones that were used in the building of new towns following [The Collapse](/the-collapse). He lost his right arm and part of his face and was left for dead after a rebellion, led by [Or Flatstone](/or-flatstone).

## Recovery and training
Not much is known about the events that followed the rebellion at the quarry. It is rumored that, ashamed of his defeat, Gorgrath retreated to the [Mountains of Triz](/mountains-of-triz) where he started training for his eventual revenge on [Or Flatstone](/or-flatstone).

## Revenge and death
Seven years after the rebellion at the quarry, Gorgrath sneaked into the [Town of Or](/city-of-or) wearing an iron mask and a prostetic sword-arm. He single handedly defeated the 17 dwarves guarding [Or Flatstone](/or-flatstone) before dying at the hands of Or himself, laughing loudly, with a great axe sticking out of his forehead.
