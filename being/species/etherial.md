# Etherials

The Etherials are a race of magical creatures that are small light emitting entities, they have wings and can fly. They are also incredibly powerful [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) users. The Etherials are generally a peaceful race, but they will defend themselves if necessary. If you do find yourself in the company of an Etherial, it is best to be respectful and not to anger them.
