# **Conduit Aasimar**  

![conduit-aasimar.webp](/world/conduit-aasimar.webp =500x)

**Divine envoys and living echoes of belief, Conduit Aasimar serve as the will of their patron [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity) while resonating with the shifting faiths of [Etheria](/etheria).** Unlike other aasimar, who are permanently tied to a celestial influence, Conduits act as **living anchors** for deities, ensuring their presence lingers even as faith fluctuates.  

Each Conduit Aasimar has **one primary patron [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity)**, but their connection to the divine allows them to **sense and harmonize with active deities in the region**. This makes them **diplomats of the gods**, uniquely attuned to the changing will of the people.  

## **Ability Score Increase**  
Your **Charisma** score increases by **2**, and your **Wisdom** score increases by **1**.  

## **Resonance Conduit**  
You are a bridge between the mortal and divine, amplifying the presence of your patron and detecting divine shifts.  

- You can communicate simple concepts, emotions, or intentions to any **celestial, fiend, or fey**, even if you do not share a language. This does not allow direct conversation but conveys intent.  
- After a **1-minute meditation**, you can sense whether there is an **active** or **imprinted [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity)** within the Scale. You do not automatically know their identity unless they **share a domain** with your patron or you have encountered them before.  

## **Self-Reflect**  
At the end of a **long rest**, you must **meditate and reaffirm your connection to your patron [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity)**.  

- If your will aligns with **a domain of an active [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity) in the region**, you may temporarily resonate with that divine presence.  
- If you do, you gain the **Command of the Divine** ability until your next long rest.  

### **Command of the Divine**  
Your words resonate with the will of the [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity). **Once before your next long rest, you can cast the *Command* spell**. However, the wording of your command must align with the deity’s ideals. *(Example: A war god’s command might be “Fight” or “Kneel,” while a trickster god’s could be “Falter” or “Forget.”)*  

## **Celestial Resistance**  
You have resistance to **necrotic** and **radiant** damage.  

## **Healing Hands**  
As an action, you can touch a creature to restore **hit points equal to your level**. You can’t use this trait again until you finish a **long rest**.  

## **Light Bearer**  
You know the **light** cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.  

## **Languages**  
You can speak, read, and write **Common** and **Celestial**.
