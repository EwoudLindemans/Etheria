In the deep labyrinths of the The Blooming Skein, where the roots of trees pierce even into the sleeping bones of the world, the **Grunthar Orcs** were not born—they **awakened**. Unlike their more brutish cousins, the Grunthar are creatures of wild intellect and feral magic, woven together by the will of the ancient [Demeriún](/being/ancient/demeriun.md), who once whispered into the soil to craft guardians against the decay of time itself.

A Grunthar Orc’s flesh blooms with moss, bark, and vines, their bones intertwined with living wood. Their glowing tattoos are not mere ornament—they are [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) scars, burning brighter when they channel the primal forces sleeping beneath Iridia. Their towering antlered crowns, burdened with flowers and thorns alike, mark them not just as warriors, but as shamans of the Broken Green. Many legends claim that the **Zeloréi** themselves tried to sculpt them into perfect protectors, but the stubborn spirit of the Grunthar bent even their ambition, much like a sapling twisting stubbornly against a stone.

Once, Grunthar roamed the living fortress of [Batès Lamina](/geography/settlement/fortress/bates-lamina.md), where trees bleed sap like ichor and the sky is a writhing emerald mist. Here, they guarded sacred glades that hid the fragile [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) of lost magic, and wrestled titanic serpents whose gaze could turn mountains brittle. Their enemies tell tales of Grunthar warriors who did not fall when stabbed, but instead sprouted into thorny bramble-beasts, dragging their foes into moss-choked graves.

In the present age, most Grunthar are seen as wandering relics, treated with wary reverence by the druids of The Blooming Skein and hunted by the techno-alchemists of the [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md), who covet the secrets etched in their sap-blood. Yet the Grunthar do not war blindly—they seek to reclaim the fading songs of the earth, gathering fragments of ancient [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) before it falls silent forever. 

Their society is formed not around simple tribes, but around what they call the **Thorn-Kin Circles**—groups bound by shared dreams and ancestral memories carried on winds that only Grunthar ears can hear. Leadership is not a matter of strength alone but of who can best wrestle the roaring visions of the past into prophecies for the future. Woe to the fool who mistakes a Grunthar Elder's mumbling for madness—for in their riddles might lie the next great salvation... or the roots of unstoppable ruin.

## Current Conflict

The Grunthar see the unchecked ambition of the **Ashenfang Orcs** as a direct threat to the balance of life and death. Where the Ashenfang seek to imprison and pervert the spirits of the dead, the Grunthar strive to safeguard the memory of life as a living continuum—where bones nourish roots, and spirits weave into the next cycle of breath and bloom.

As the Ashenfang Orcs desecrate sacred glades, plunder spirit wells, and shatter fossil groves, the Grunthar rise from their labyrinthine dens. Thorn-crowned warriors and vine-wreathed shamans now march alongside the defenders of the Blooming Skein, weaving resonance into living bulwarks against the bonebound abominations.

The Grunthar do not seek war—but if the Ashenfang's Unbroken Host must be broken, they will do so with root, tooth, and ancient wrath.

**They fight not to conquer.
They fight so that life may never forget how to bloom from bone.**
