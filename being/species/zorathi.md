# The Zorathi Nomads
![zorathi.webp](/images/world/zorathi.webp)

## Description
The Zorathi are a race of towering, muscular nomads who traverse the desert not as conquerors, but as protectors. Known as the “Sun’s Kin” in ancient tongue, they are revered for their immense strength, ageless wisdom, and unwavering kindness. Despite their intimidating appearance, the Zorathi are considered sacred allies by many desert peoples, often appearing in times of dire need.

## Appearance
Zorathi are between 8 and 9 feet tall with statuesque, muscular frames. Their skin is a deep bronze or polished obsidian, often glistening faintly under the sun. Most wear regal desert cloaks dyed in rich reds, golds, and coppers, adorned with ancient runes passed down by lineage. Beaded necklaces and metallic cuffs mark their status within the tribe. Their broad faces are framed by bald heads or tightly bound topknots, and they bear deep smiles that radiate peace and strength.

## Culture
Zorathi culture revolves around the concept of *Sa’Harim* — “The Steady Flame” — a philosophy that teaches strength should serve compassion. Their society is organized into traveling clans known as *Tor-Karrim*, each led by a *Verdant Flame*, a leader elected by merit of heart rather than might.

They practice oral tradition, storytelling, and ceremonial sand glyph rituals to record their history. Music and dance are essential to their gatherings, with heavy drums and slow, powerful movements mirroring the endurance of their journey across the ever-changing dunes.

## Abilities
- **Enduring Might:** Zorathi are immune to exhaustion from travel caused by heat or sand-based terrain.
- **Cloak of Kinship:** Once per long rest, a Zorathi can wrap a willing ally in their cloak, granting them resistance to one damage type for 1 hour.
- **Desert Presence:** Creatures that see a Zorathi for the first time in social or combat situations must make a DC 14 WIS save or be charmed for 1 minute, as their presence calms tension instinctively.

## Relations
The Zorathi are respected as neutral arbiters and sacred guides. Even rival desert factions often suspend conflicts when a Zorathi is near. Outsiders who earn their trust may be granted the rare blessing of *Sunbound Oath*, marking them as a friend of the Zorathi people.

## Names
Zorathi names are lyrical with syllables echoing like drumbeats. Prefixes like *Vor-*, *Ka’har-*, and *Zu-* are common.
Examples: *Vorun-Ka*, *Zu’Mellari*, *Ka’harun*, *Tazum-Vorr*, *Ordu-Vehl*.
