# The Uroxi – Lantern-Blooded of the Hollow Veins

![uroxi.webp](/characters/uroxi.webp =500x)

Deep beneath the crust of Morakai, in the glass-veined chasms known only as the **Umbral Seep**, thrives a race that glimmers like molten shadow and pulses with stolen light: the **Uroxi**. At first glance, surfacefolk might mistake them for deep gnomes or duergar—but the Uroxi are neither stone nor sullen. They are **biolux sentients**, shaped by subterranean [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md), light-eating fungi, and forgotten glimmers buried since [The Collapse](/structure/chronological/event/the-collapse.md).

An Uroxi's form is short and stocky, built to navigate collapsed tunnel systems and vertical shafts. Their skin appears like polished coal threaded with veins of glowing sap-light—amber, teal, or crimson depending on lineage. Their eyes glow with a warm internal luminance, and their forearms contain natural **phosphor sacs**, which swell with radiant fluid when they’re excited, afraid, or joyful. These sacs are used for both communication and defense—bursting in blinding pulses or soft beacon flares.

Their hair, when present, grows in thick tendrils resembling translucent kelp or glassy moss, often woven into **light-ritual braids** that track significant events or personal oaths. Many surfacefolk assume they are constructs or alchemical hybrids, but Uroxi are entirely biological—just deeply altered by their luminous environment.

The Uroxi live in vast caverns cradled within hollow crystals, where ambient glowstone provides constant dim warmth. Their capital, **Zhay-Phorran**, is an inverted city—hanging from the ceiling like a nest of glass lanterns. Its citizens traverse its winding paths by magnetized boots, slow leaps, and gentle gliding lifts carved from buoyant fungus bladders.

Culturally, they believe that **light is inherited**, passed from action to action like a flame across candles. Uroxi are trained in “Lightbinding,” an art that lets them store, reflect, and shape light for practical, ceremonial, or defensive purposes. Their warriors, called **Glowshapers**, wield weapons infused with their own stored light, bending beams into hardened force or searing arcs.

They are often employed by surface settlements like [Triz Valley](/location/settlement/city/triz-valley.md) and The [City of Or](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or.md) as tunnel guides, ruin-scanners, or luminous pathmakers in regions where traditional light sources fail or feed dangerous fauna.

Despite their subterranean lifestyle, the Uroxi are curious, humorous, and stubbornly optimistic. They have a saying etched into the arches of Zhay-Phorran:

> “We were not born in darkness. We were born where the light got clever.”
> — Lys Kellenlight, Uroxi Beacon-Warden
