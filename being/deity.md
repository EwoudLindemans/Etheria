# The Divine Scales of Etheria

## The Will of Etheria & The Cycle of Divinity
Etheria’s gods are not eternal beings, but manifestations of collective faith—reflections of mortal will given divine form. The Scales of Etheria, vast regions of belief, determine which deities hold power in different parts of the world. No deity is truly permanent, nor is any ever fully gone; their existence is dictated by the ebb and flow of worship.

At the heart of this cosmic balance is **Irion’s Will**, a fundamental force that prevents sudden divine shifts, ensuring that belief changes gradually rather than chaotically. However, during times of great upheaval—war, disaster, or revolution—faith surges unpredictably, allowing deities to rise and fall more swiftly.

The life cycle of a deity follows these core principles:

- **Resonance Convergence** – When a new belief grows strong enough, a deity emerges to embody it.
- **Resonance Drift** – A deity may move to another Scale if belief there becomes more aligned with its nature.
- **Resonance Fade** – If faith wanes, a deity does not die but lingers as an imprint, waiting for belief to restore it.
- **Resonance Weave** – Where scales overlap, divine domains may blend, forming unique hybrid deities.

Some deities manipulate faith to survive, shifting their domains or merging with rivals. Others passively endure, sustained by deep traditions. A few accept their decline, fading into echoes.

## The Ancient Gods & The War of Equal Balance
Long before Etheria’s modern divine cycle, an era of great gods ruled the world. These **Ancient Gods** were among the first to emerge, their power drawn from the raw faith of early civilizations. Legends claim they were fragments of **Irion**, the primordial cosmic entity whose shattered body became the foundation of Etheria itself.

For a time, the Ancient Gods guided mortal societies, shaping the world through divine influence. But as their ambitions grew, so did their conflicts. No longer content with guiding mortals, they sought dominion over faith itself, manipulating their followers into endless war to sustain their own power.

This era of divine warfare became known as the **War of Equal Balance**. The gods, bound by their immortality, could not be slain—but they could not allow one another to reign supreme. Their battles shattered civilizations, causing faith to fracture across Etheria.

It was then that the mortals rebelled. A coalition of scholars, warriors, and rogue deities—**the Alliance of Adequate Resolve**—devised a way to sever the gods from Etheria. They enacted a great ritual that forcibly **Resonance Faded** the Ancient Gods, imprisoning them in the void between realms. Their divine forms were sealed within statues, altars, and monuments, transforming them into mere echoes of their former selves.

Thus, the modern divine system was born. **Irion’s Will**, once shattered, stabilized Etheria by ensuring that no deity could ever again rise unchecked. Since that time, deities have only emerged through **Resonance Convergence**, shaped purely by mortal faith rather than divine ambition.

## The Black Hole & The Cosmic Paradox
Though the Ancient Gods were cast into exile, their power was not fully extinguished. Their lingering influence pooled within a celestial phenomenon known as **the Black Hole**—a void that hungers for belief and divine energy. Some say this is where **Irion’s** last remnants slumber, subtly guiding Etheria’s fate. Others fear it is a prison, holding something far older and more dangerous than even the gods.

The Black Hole serves as the ultimate **Resonance Anchor**, absorbing excess divine power and preventing the rise of uncontrolled deities. It ensures the balance of faith, stopping any single god from dominating all of Etheria. However, should the barriers weaken, the Ancient Gods—or something far worse—may yet return.

Even now, scattered ruins, forgotten altars, and secret cults seek to restore the old gods. If enough belief gathers, an Ancient God may **Resonate Back** into existence, returning in a new form shaped by the faith of the modern era.

Etheria stands at the crossroads of fate. The deities shift, belief wavers, and the scales tremble once more. Whether balance holds—or shatters—remains to be seen.
