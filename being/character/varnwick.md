# Varnwick "Twistroot" Marnel  
*“If the trees speak in riddles, then I must be their punchline.”*

There are those who wander the Cracks near [The Dense](/geography/realm/the-dense.md) for power. Others seek ancient truths, forbidden knowledge, or shiny things. Varnwick Marnel did not set out for any of those. He was looking for berries. Not just any berries—he was on a lifelong, deeply irrational quest to find and catalog every variety of fruit ending in "-ility." That he somehow survived this fruit-fueled folly is either a miracle, a cosmic prank, or a grim indicator of how little the universe cares for sensible outcomes.

Varnwick is a root-footed gnome—or as he calls himself, a *Verdant Grovetwister*. His legs have long since been replaced by braided vines and moss-cloaked branches. A gift (or curse) from the time he tripped headfirst into an unstable patch of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)'s Residue and merged with the local flora. He now walks on living roots that adjust to terrain, mood, and sometimes just to mess with people. His laugh is like creaking bark, and his beard grows leaves in the spring.

He dwells within a forgotten [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) Conduit Grove nestled between the [Mountains of Triz](/geography/region/mountains-of-triz.md) and the lowlands that feed into [Arkona](/geography/settlement/city/arkona.md). There, he cultivates bizarre hybrid berries: the *Stabilityfruit* (immovable once planted), *Fertilityfruit* (do *not* plant near rabbits), and the regrettable *Hostilityfruit* (explodes into bitter insults when bitten). Rumor has it he once tried to cross a Reliabilaberry with a mushroom. The resulting “Responsibilityshroom” promptly fired him from his own garden.

Despite his eccentric nature, Varnwick is no fool. His affinity with the Residue has made him something of a wild [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) gardener—a geomancer whose spells involve roots that drag enemies under, pollen that induces hallucinations of bureaucratic nightmares, and vines that play jazz when no one’s watching. He distrusts most cityfolk, especially those from [Mohinders](/geography/settlement/city/mohinders.md), claiming their obsession with magical order “makes the weeds cry.”

His only companion is an overly smug fruit bat named Thimble, who may or may not be an agent of The [Cult of Dy](/structure/society/factions/cult-of-dy.md). Varnwick claims Thimble wins dice rolls by cheating reality and once bit a cleric out of spite.

There’s a growing belief among the Followers of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md) that Varnwick is not entirely gnome anymore—that something ancient is beginning to bloom inside him. Whether he becomes a protector of the [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) or a walking agricultural catastrophe remains to be seen. For now, he’s just the odd root-legged hermit muttering to berries, dragging cartloads of vines, and occasionally shouting, “No! You water *yourself* this time!”
