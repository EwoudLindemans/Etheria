# Cirxa, The Candle-Eyed Broker

> *"Everything has a price. Even silence. Especially silence."*

![cirxa.webp](/characters/cirxa.webp =500x)

In the mist-drenched corridors of [Arkona](/geography/settlement/city/arkona.md), where whispered rumors flicker brighter than lanterns, a figure drifts like a wisp of smoke through back alleys and midnight markets. This is **Cirxa**, the enigmatic tiefling known as the **Candle-Eyed Broker**, a dealer of secrets, curses, and unusually well-mannered spirits. Few know where she came from, fewer still know where she truly lives—but all know to come with coin *and* caution.

## Origins in Unrecorded Ink

Cirxa claims to hail from a forgotten settlement called **Ossinreach**, which, naturally, no one can seem to find on any map. Scholars from [Scholar’s Rift](/geography/settlement/enclave/scholars-rift/scholars-rift.md) argue that it might be a temporal echo—a village that exists only at midnight under a waxing moon. Others suggest she simply made it up to mess with historians, and frankly, that seems likely.

Her appearance is a paradox of elegance and dread: ash-gray skin, hair like unraveling silk, and eyes replaced with two flickering, sentient candleflames. The flames never burn out, and those who stare into them too long often walk away muttering things they never knew they knew. It’s said these flames were a gift from the Unborn—a [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md) who carved her destiny using wax instead of fate.

## Traits & Talents

Cirxa is not a warrior, nor a mage in the traditional sense. Her [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) deals with contracts—unseen threads spun from whispered promises, oaths, and secrets no one dares write down. She can conjure illusions made from memories, summon invisible truths to whisper in your ears, or bind a liar’s tongue with a single word.

It is also said she once bartered a storm from a Sky-Monarch in the mountains, in exchange for a song that hadn’t been sung in three centuries. She keeps the storm in a glass vial. The song? Well, she claims she hums it when she's bored.

Her most infamous deal involved selling a silence so deep it consumed a city’s entire library for one night. What did the buyer get in return? No one knows. The books returned at dawn, slightly rearranged… and slightly sarcastic.

## Role in Iridia

Cirxa acts as a neutral agent between factions like **The [Arcane Fangs](/structure/society/factions/arcane-fangs.md)** and the **Council of Elders**. She sells information, occasionally artifacts, and sometimes entire destinies. She has dealings in [Triz Valley](/geography/settlement/city/triz-valley.md), where she is persona non grata after a rather inconvenient prophecy-fulfilling incident involving an aggressive potato cult and a misunderstood tomato festival.

Even the [Ragged Goons](/structure/society/factions/ragged-goons.md) have approached her for [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) fragments, only to be rebuffed with a smile and the words: "You couldn't afford the truth even if you sold your future twice."

## Personality

Cirxa is neither good nor evil—she’s practical. Every favor earns a favor, every word has weight. She is endlessly amused by mortal arrogance and surprisingly gentle to children, cats, and those who cry honestly. She will never lie, but she also never gives a full answer unless it’s amusing.

She prefers shadowy corners, warm tea, and riddles with no correct solution. Her laugh is soft, but never kind.

## Strange Rumors:
- Some say Cirxa *is* a [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) fragment given life.
- Others believe her candle-eyes see through time and that she weeps wax only when someone she’s met dies.
- It’s whispered that she keeps a ledger of the world’s last secrets—and there’s only one page left.

Wherever truth bends and deals are struck in half-light, Cirxa is never far. Whether you're buying a rumor, bargaining for safety, or trading away your ability to whistle… you'll find her watching.

And the candles? They’re always listening.
