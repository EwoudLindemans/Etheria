# Nokk, The Scale’s Chosen
*"[Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) should be free, chaotic, and powerful. Just… not in my hands. Seriously, get behind cover."*

![nokk.webp](/characters/nokk.webp =500x)

## Origins & Legend  
Legends speak of a sorcerer whose [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) bends the very elements, shaping water, air, and flame with raw, unpredictable force. Nokk was not born with resonance—it was thrust upon him in a moment of chaotic fate when he swallowed a fish infused with the power of the Dense. 

From that moment, the world around him twisted with surges of chaos energy. Some say he is a conduit for forces beyond mortal understanding, a storm given flesh. Others whisper that something in the chaos watches him, waiting for the moment to reclaim what he stole.

## Rift gate paradox
The greatest mystery surrounding Nokk is his inexplicable connection to [the Rift Gate](/geography/settlement/enclave/scholars-rift/the-rift-gate.md)’s creation—an event that, according to all recorded history, predated him by centuries.

## Physical Description  
- **Height:** 1.68 meters  
- **Build:** Medium, slightly wiry but resilient  
- **Appearance:** A Iridian with deep blue skin, draped in a ragged cloak that crackles with residual [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md). His eyes, once ordinary, now shimmer with the light of a storm barely contained.  
- **Hair:** None—his own [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) burned it away, leaving him permanently bald.  
- **Distinguishing Features:** Often surrounded by an aura of fluctuating elemental energy, unintentionally altering his environment.  

## Abilities & Traits  
- **Elemental Conduit** – Nokk’s [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) draws from the raw forces of nature, manifesting as fire, ice, or lightning at random.  
- **Chaos [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Burst** – When casting a spell, the weave of resonance frays around him, occasionally unleashing chaotic and unexpected effects.  
- **Tides of Chaos** – Can manipulate fate, granting himself an advantage on rolls—but at the cost of triggering more chaos [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md).  
- **Scale’s Echo** – Some believe his connection to the scale's is growing stronger, influencing his power in ways even he doesn’t understand.  

## Temperament & Behavior  
Nokk is both a scholar and a disaster waiting to happen. He sees [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) as an untamed force meant to be free, but his personal experience with it has made him cautious (at least when he remembers to be). His chaotic nature masks a deep fear: what if he truly can’t control his own resonance? What if one day, he unleashes something he can’t take back?

Despite this, his determination to master his abilities drives him forward, even as he leaves behind a trail of accidental explosions, bald companions, and waterlogged libraries.

## The Mystery of Nokk  
Nokk is more than just an unlucky sorcerer—his power is linked to something far older. The **magical stone**, an artifact of unknown origin, seems to whisper in his dreams, its influence creeping into his [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md). 

Is he merely a byproduct of Chaos [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md), or is he a vessel for something greater? Only time will tell.

## Hi, I'm Nokk, a young Iridian.  
From the city of Valthor in the lands of Moist Crusted Lane.  

Nothing close to a sorcerer though. I'm really bad at it. It’s not that I *can’t* use [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) or that I’m not strong. It’s more that I have this one little problem, and it **ALWAYS KEEPS HAPPENING!** Egghhh. I get so mad when it happens. I mean, training for over **ten years** now must have given me enough skill, right?!  

Well, I guess you want to know what my problem is, huh? Alright, here we go—  

Oh wait!  

Before I tell you, I must share a bit more about myself. I’m **25 years old**. And I *love* going on adventures. If I get the *slightest* reason to go somewhere, I just do it. It’s not like my parents care anyway. They’re always **busy, busy** with work.  

**WELL, NOT ME!**  

I’m not gonna work. I’m gonna be the **best SORCERER in the WORLD!**  
I’ll be casting spells like a storm in no time!  

Now that you’ve listened this far, maybe you understand why I want to leave this **damned** place.  
Well… my little problem is that I **cannot control my powers.**  

Ha! I said it. Now you’re probably wondering how I *got* my powers, right?  

Well—  

The other day, I was out on my own. I went swimming, and I saw a strange fish appear. I dunno what kind of fish it was, but it just **appeared** out of nowhere. And—well—unfortunately, the thing **swam straight into my mouth.** And as a quick reaction, I **swallowed it whole.**  

**How was I supposed to know what would happen after…?**  

I **traveled** somewhere else!. I can’t really describe it since my memories are vague. All I know is that ever since I *returned,* I can control the elements.  

I think I **took something** from that place. And I have this feeling that *something* or *someone* is trying to **take it back.**  

My training institute always tells me I have this **greeaaaat potential.** Blegh. I don’t get it. Everything I do **misfires.** They’re lucky I haven’t set the place on fire yet.  

**Oh wait. I did.**  

Maybe that’s why my teachers never let me do the *real* stuff. I’m really getting sick of making doors clap. I mean—**everyone** can do that, right?  

I *try* to do good, but all sorts of things keep happening. It’s strange.  
One time—haha, great times—I was with my friends **Erill and Olaz**, and I tried to draw a sigil.  

They both turned **bald for a whole day.**  

Anyway, I don’t think I can stay here much longer. It’s getting worse. The things that happen keep getting more **dangerous.** I really hope I can get this under control. **I MUST.**  

Well. I’m done with it.  

I’m **leaving** this place.  

All I have here are my **botherless** parents and this **stupid** institution.  
After what happened with my friends, I don’t even see them anymore.  

I’m **running away** from all this **NONSENSE!**  

I’ll go into the world and **train myself.** I don’t think I can learn more in this **forgotten** place.  

I somehow seem to have made a **connection** with the **magical stone.**  
I don’t know why or *how* it happened, but hey—it happened.  

Since then, a Titan has been after me.  
He wants to sever the connection—**killing me.**  

I *hope* he can’t reach me. But I don’t really know.  
I’m **scared.**
