# Covenant of Thalgrin and Ilmater

In the [City of Or](/geography/settlement/city/city-of-or.md), where the clang of forge-hammers [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) like prayer, it was **[Thalgrin](/being/deity/thalgrin.md), the Heartbound Smith**, who permitted the red thread of **[Ilmater](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ilmater)** to enter [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) not as a flood of divine foreignness, but as a trickle of healing fire.

[Thalgrin](/being/deity/thalgrin.md), god of craft and endurance, did not allow *all* of Ilmater's power. He is no martyr, no weeper of wounds. But when he saw **[Sylieth](/being/character/sylieth.md)**, a Tiefling whose hands stitched bodies as a smith would steel, he understood. The *healing* they offered—the slow mending of flesh and [soul](/raw/20250501/soul/soul.md)—was not weakness. It was **forging**.

**Pain**, [Thalgrin](/being/deity/thalgrin.md) said, is not to be wasted. It is to be **tempered**.

And so he allowed Ilmater’s mercy through [the Binding Thread](/being/character/sylieth/the-binding-thread.md), likening the suffering it required to the pain of hammer striking metal—**a cost for creation**. In [Thalgrin](/being/deity/thalgrin.md)’s eyes, every wound [Sylieth](/being/character/sylieth.md) bore was a forge-spark. Every sorrow held was the ring of iron meeting flame. The Broken God could not claim [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md), but he could lend his fire to one who forged through mercy.

And thus the red thread burns quietly still—*not soft, but sacred*, forged in pain, permitted by steel.
