# Matt "The Phantom Swashbuckler"  
*"A ship is only as loyal as its crew… and a crew is only as loyal as the gold in their pockets."*  

![matt.png](/characters/matt.png =x500)

## Origins & Legend  
Born and raised in the Pirate’s Cove, Matt never knew his parents. Instead, he was taken in by Pale Rupert, a notorious rogue known as "The Shadow," who taught him the art of deception, agility, and survival. At 11, Matt was hired by Captain Omar, serving under him for decades until a brutal sea battle changed everything.  

With the captain slain and the crew in chaos, Matt saw an opportunity—he forged documents claiming Omar had left all his belongings to him. In one daring stroke, he stole the entire fortune (about 7297 platinum) and vanished into legend. Some whisper that Omar’s ghost haunts him still, waiting for revenge. Others say Matt’s cunning and audacity could make him the greatest swashbuckler of all time—if his past doesn’t catch up with him first.  

## Physical Description  
- **Height:** 170 cm (5’7”)  
- **Build:** Lean but wiry, built for speed and agility  
- **Appearance:** A pale-skinned rogue with a mischievous smirk, usually seen wearing a weathered long coat, high leather boots, and a wide-brimmed hat with a feather  
- **Hair:** Brown… ish (unkempt, often windswept from the sea)  
- **Distinguishing Features:** Wears an eye patch over his right eye, though he never actually lost it—it's just a story he sticks to fervently  

## Abilities & Traits  
- **Deceptive Duelist** – Matt is an expert at misdirection, feints, and quick strikes, making him difficult to predict in combat.  
- **Ghost of the Sea** – Rumors say he can disappear in the blink of an eye, his movements as fluid as the waves.  
- **Cursed Fortune** – The stolen inheritance brings both wealth and misfortune—strange omens seem to follow him, and he fears supernatural retribution.  

## Temperament & Behavior  
Matt presents himself as a carefree and charismatic rogue, always quick with a jest or a well-placed bluff. He values friendships but fears true loyalty, as his past betrayals weigh heavily on him. He believes in the power of gold over ideals, though deep down, he yearns for genuine companionship.  

- **Self-image:** A daring swashbuckler, destined for greatness  
- **Reality:** A man running from the ghosts of his past, both metaphorical and perhaps literal  
- **Philosophy:** "Plans are just guidelines for fools who can’t improvise."  
- **Fears:** Being outwitted, supernatural revenge, his past being uncovered  
- **Relationships:** Seeks camaraderie but struggles with trust, as he has built his life on deception  

## The Mystery of Matt  
Some say that Captain Omar’s treasure was cursed, and Matt unknowingly brought misfortune upon himself by taking it. Others believe he was never just an ordinary rogue—whispers in dark taverns suggest he may have a secret bloodline tied to something far more sinister.  

## Hi, I'm Matt, Human, Age 40.  
I was raised by thieves, lived among pirates, and outplayed the lot of them. I've seen the rise and fall of great men, and I've learned one thing—fortunes favor the bold. Some call me a liar, a cheat, a scoundrel, but I prefer "resourceful entrepreneur."  

You’ll hear tales of how I lost my eye in battle, how I sailed under Captain Omar, and how I walked away with a ship’s worth of treasure. But the real question is… do you believe all of it? If you do, then maybe you’re exactly the kind of fool I need.
