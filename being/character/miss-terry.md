## Karmic Slap
Miss Terry, a mischievous tiefling, lived for tricks and trouble. She stole a coin—then slipped and fell. She flirted with a taken barmaid—only to be punched mid-kiss. A dice gamble left her broke, and a prank ended with her in a barrel. In the end, [Karmic Slap](/i/98) had her dancing to its beat.

[Verse 1]
Oh, gather ye 'round and hear my plight, 
Of folly, fate, and misplaced might! 
I swiped a coin, thought none would see, 
But karma had a slap for me!

[Chorus]
The karmic slap, it comes around,
One swift crack and down ye go!
Think ye sly? Ye’ll kiss the ground,
For justice loves a good back-blow!

[Verse 2]
I wooed a lad with words so sweet, 
Swore my heart would ne’er retreat, 
But just as I leaned in for a kiss, 
His wife's slap said, "No, not like this!"
But just as I leaned in for a kiss, 
His wife's slap said, "No, not like this!"

[Chorus]
Ohhh, the karmic slap, it comes around, 
One swift crack and down ye go!
Think ye sly? Ye’ll kiss the ground,
For justice loves a good back-blow!

[Verse 3]
I wagered all on dice so bold, 
Dreams of silver, dreams of gold! 
But luck it laughed, the dice did sneer, 
Now I owe more than I own, I fear!

[Chorus]
Ohhh, the karmic slap, it comes around,
One swift crack and down ye go!
Think ye sly? Ye’ll kiss the ground,
For justice loves a good back-blow!

[Verse 4]
A trick I played, so sharp, so grand, 
Tied me mate’s boots with cunning hand! 
But as he tripped, he flailed ‘round wide, 
And sent me tumbling on my backside!

[Chorus Variation]
Ohhh, the karmic slap, it comes around, 
One swift crack and down ye go!
And when ye finally hit the ground
You'll meet with justices back-blow!

[Outro]
So raise a glass, heed well this song, 
What ye give shall come along! 
For every prank and every trick, 
Karma’s got a slap that’s quick!

Huzzah!
