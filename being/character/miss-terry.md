# Miss Terry
**The Enigma of [the Brazen Burp](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-brazen-burp.md)**

![miss_terry_cartoon.webp](/characters/miss_terry_cartoon.webp =500x)

Few names in The [City of Or](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or.md) carry as much simultaneous reverence and bewilderment as Miss Terry, the jolly Tiefling bard of [the Brazen Burp](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-brazen-burp.md). She is often called “Mystery” by those slurring their words too hard to get it right. To call her simply a performer would be a grave understatement—she is the heart of the tavern, the spark that keeps its fire burning, and the unsolvable riddle that keeps its regulars guessing.

Among [the Brazen Burp](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-brazen-burp.md)’s regulars, Miss Terry is a revered figure. Many an outsider has learned that any insult directed at her will earn  a reputation so tarnished that no tavern in The [City of Or](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or.md) will serve them again. Yet, for all their fierce loyalty, Miss Terry needs no protection. Those who mistake her for helpless quickly find themselves on the receiving end of a sharp tongue, sharper wit, and if needed, a perfectly thrown tankard. Still, she humors her self-appointed guardians, accepting their watchful eyes with a knowing smirk. After all, a queen must have her devoted subjects.

She occasionaly works the taproom at the Rusty Keg in [Triz Valley](/location/settlement/city/triz-valley.md).

## The Eternal Mystery

Miss Terry’s origins are a topic of heated debate among patrons, and she enjoys nothing more than fueling the confusion. To the curious, she spins a new tale each time:
- She was born from the tear of a lovestruck [deity](/structure/mechanic/deity.md).
- She emerged fully formed from a cursed lute that played itself.
- She once dueled a sphinx, but instead of riddles, they exchanged increasingly absurd rumors about each other until both conceded defeat.
- She once talked a drunk troll out of eating a halfling by challenging him to a drinking contest—and winning.

Despite all her antics, Miss Terry remains an unsolved riddle, and she seems perfectly content that way. If there is a grand truth behind her ever-changing tales, it is likely hidden within a song, woven between the notes of a melody only she truly understands. And perhaps, just perhaps, that’s exactly how she wants it. Whatever the truth may be, she never confirms nor denies anything outright—she only winks and pours another drink.


## The Joyfull Bard 🎵 
Miss Terry is a natural force of music and mischief. When she sings, her voice fills [the Brazen Burp](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-brazen-burp.md) without the need for any unnatural amplification—carrying through roaring laughter and clinking tankards with a clarity that commands attention. Whether backed by The [Rusty Pluckers](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or/shop/the-brazen-burp/rusty-pluckers.md), the tavern’s ever-enthusiastic half-orc band, or taking the stage alone with nothing but a sly grin and a flick of her tail, she turns even the most hardened drinker into a swaying, sentimental fool. Most assume her songs are tall tales until they realize every verse hides a lesson, a truth, or a veiled warning. Her eyes are always watching, and many a schemer has found themselves the butt of her next performance.

Yet, when she’s not performing, she moves through the tavern with unmatched energy, waiting tables, flirting shamelessly, and keeping the place in order with the authority of an adored yet untouchable queen.

|Bard of many Things|<audio controls="1" controlslist="noplaybackrate" src="/music/miss_terry-bard_of_many_things.mp3"></audio>|A clever bard weaves his legend through chaos and song, avoiding danger while others do the heavy lifting.

After all—what's truth to a bard who can make the world sing?<details><summary>Lyrics</summary>[Verse 1]<br />There once was a town with a terrible plight, <br />A dragon, a curse, and a famine (all right?), <br />The heroes arrived with a glint in their eye— <br />And one brought a mirror to check his hair tie.<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />While warriors clashed with the fangs and the flame, <br />And wizards threw spells that would scramble your name, <br />He ducked through the chaos with elegant flair— <br />And might have tripped over a maiden’s despair.<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Oh sing me the song of the bard of renown, <br />Who fought with a feather and wrote the beast down! <br />With tales never his, but oh how he sings— <br />All hail! The Bard of Many Things!<br /><br />[Verse 3]<br />A goblin uprising once shook the east pass, <br />While he held a toast and a tall looking-glass. <br />The rogue set the traps, the monk rang the bell— <br />He penned a sonnet and fainted quite well.<br /><br />[Verse 4]<br />A lich cast a hex on the party one day, <br />He scribbled it down—then got out the way. <br />The cleric did smite, the ranger took aim— <br />He rhymed “necromancer” with “dancer of fame.”<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Oh sing me the song of the bard in the fray, <br />Who danced through the fire and sipped his rosé. <br />A hero? Perhaps! At least while he sings— <br />All hail! The Bard of Many Things!<br />Who danced through the fire and sipped his rosé. <br />A hero? Perhaps! At least while he sings— <br />All hail! The Bard of Many Things!<br /><br />[Bridge]<br />Did he slay the beast?<br />"No, but he watched."<br />Did he seal the breach? <br />"From a very safe spot."<br />Did he take the crown, the coin, and the ring? <br />"No, he named the quest, and made it sing."<br /><br />[Verse 5]<br />Now songs of his daring are sung far and wide, <br />By bards who don’t know he just ran to the side. <br />But none can deny he’s a legend, you see— <br />Especially he, if you ask only he.<br /><br />[Final Chorus]<br />Oh sing me the song of the sly and the slick, <br />Who earned all the glory, and none of the nick. <br />With wit as his blade and charm for his wings— <br />All hail!
