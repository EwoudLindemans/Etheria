# Miss Terry
**Bar(d)maid of Trouble and Tune — Serving Ale with a Side of Irony**

![miss_terry_cartoon.webp](/characters/miss_terry_cartoon.webp =500x)


Miss Terry, often called “Mystery” by those slurring their words too hard to get it right, is a mischievous tiefling barmaid with a sharp wit and an even sharper tongue. She works the taproom at the Rusty Keg in Triz Valley, where rumor says she once talked a drunk troll out of eating a halfling by challenging him to a drinking contest—and winning.

## 🎵 Songs

Equal parts bard and barmaid, she sings as easily as she serves. Most assume her songs are tall tales until they realize every verse hides a lesson, a truth, or a veiled warning. Her eyes are always watching, and many a schemer has found themselves the butt of her next performance. Miss Terry has a past, sure, but she’ll only reveal it in rhymes—and only after you've bought her three drinks.  

### Karmic Slap

Miss Terry’s crowd favorite, *[Karmic Slap](/i/98)*, tells the tale of her own misadventures—coin theft, ill-fated flirts, risky gambles, and a legendary prank gone wrong. Each verse ends with poetic justice smacking her upside the head.  

The song's rhythm is cheeky and bold, often accompanied by foot-stomps, table-knocks, and rowdy clapping. It’s performed with a wink, and usually leaves someone in the crowd nervously wondering if they’re next.

[Verse 1]
Oh, gather ye 'round and hear my plight, 
Of folly, fate, and misplaced might! 
I swiped a coin, thought none would see, 
But karma had a slap for me!

[Chorus]
The karmic slap, it comes around,
One swift crack and down ye go!
Think ye sly? Ye’ll kiss the ground,
For justice loves a good back-blow!

[Verse 2]
I wooed a lad with words so sweet, 
Swore my heart would ne’er retreat, 
But just as I leaned in for a kiss, 
His wife's slap said, "No, not like this!"

[Chorus]
Ohhh, the karmic slap, it comes around, 
One swift crack and down ye go!
Think ye sly? Ye’ll kiss the ground,
For justice loves a good back-blow!

[Verse 3]
I wagered all on dice so bold, 
Dreams of silver, dreams of gold! 
But luck it laughed, the dice did sneer, 
Now I owe more than I own, I fear!

[Chorus]
Ohhh, the karmic slap, it comes around,
One swift crack and down ye go!
Think ye sly? Ye’ll kiss the ground,
For justice loves a good back-blow!

[Verse 4]
A trick I played, so sharp, so grand, 
Tied me mate’s boots with cunning hand! 
But as he tripped, he flailed ‘round wide, 
And sent me tumbling on my backside!

[Chorus Variation]
Ohhh, the karmic slap, it comes around, 
One swift crack and down ye go!
And when ye finally hit the ground
You'll meet with justices back-blow!

[Outro]
So raise a glass, heed well this song, 
What ye give shall come along! 
For every prank and every trick, 
Karma’s got a slap that’s quick!

Huzzah!
