# Anemostrus – The Skyborne Colossus  
"The winds whisper its name, the clouds part in its wake. It does not march, it glides—an ancient titan carried by the breath of the heavens."

## Origins & Legend  
Anemostrus is a living remnant of an age when the sky and earth were one. Some say it was forged by the gods of wind to carry the weight of the skies, its massive shell reflecting the ever-changing heavens. Others believe it predates the deities themselves, a primordial force that has drifted across the world for eons, shaping weather patterns with its mere presence.

## Physical Description  
- **Height:** 80 to 100 feet when standing  
- **Weight:** An unfathomable mass, yet it moves with surprising grace  
- **Appearance:** A gargantuan tortoise-like entity with a shell resembling a swirling stormfront. Wisps of mist and trailing gusts dance across its surface, while jagged, cloudlike spikes protrude from its back like storm-forged mountains.  
- **Eyes:** Piercing silver orbs, reflecting the endless sky and shifting with the winds.  
- **Legs & Movement:** Despite its bulk, Anemostrus moves with an unnatural lightness, each step barely disturbing the earth. When fully airborne, it glides effortlessly, as though carried by unseen currents.  

## Abilities & Traits  
- **Windborne Leviathan** – Anemostrus defies gravity, able to hover and soar despite its immense size.  
- **Living Stormfront** – Its presence alone bends the weather, summoning clouds and shifting the wind at will.  
- **Skyshield Carapace** – The swirling patterns of its shell form an ever-shifting barrier, dispersing magical and physical assaults alike.  
- **Zephyr’s Breath** – Anemostrus exhales a colossal gust of wind, capable of sweeping away entire armies.  
- **Cyclonic Slumber** – When it rests, a vast storm brews around it, concealing its form within an eternal tempest.  

## Temperament & Behavior  
Anemostrus is a contemplative and ancient being, rarely engaging in battle unless provoked. It drifts through the world like a wandering island, its movements slow but deliberate. Though peaceful by nature, those who seek to harness or challenge its power will find themselves facing the fury of the skies.

## The Mystery of Anemostrus  
Some scholars believe that Anemostrus holds knowledge of the world’s oldest secrets, having witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations from above. Others whisper that its shell contains the lost histories of the wind gods, inscribed in the ever-changing patterns of its carapace. Whatever the truth, those who seek it must first weather the storms that follow in Anemostrus’s wake.
