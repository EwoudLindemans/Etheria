# Rhyzmare, The Coral Wrath
"The ocean does not rage, nor does it relent. It moves with patience, yet drowns with certainty. Rhyzmare is the tide given form, an eternal force of the deep."

## Origins & Legend  
Sailors whisper of a being that stirs beneath the waves, a colossal titan formed of living water and ancient coral. Some claim it is the guardian of the ocean’s balance, rising only when the seas are threatened. Others fear it is the embodiment of nature’s wrath, an unstoppable tide that swallows entire fleets and reshapes coastlines at its whim.

Legends speak of Rhyzmare as neither living nor dead, but an extension of the ocean itself. It does not hunger, nor does it sleep—its only purpose is to endure, flowing with the endless currents of time.

## Physical Description  
- **Height:** 80+ feet, though its form is constantly shifting  
- **Weight:** Immeasurable, composed of water and coral-like structures  
- **Appearance:** A towering, fluid colossus whose body moves like an ocean given form. Sections of its mass solidify into jagged reefs and spiraling shells, only to dissolve back into water moments later.  
- **Eyes:** Deep-set orbs of bioluminescent blue, glowing like the abyssal depths.  
- **Limbs & Structure:** Rhyzmare has no fixed form—one moment, its arms resemble crashing waves; the next, they harden into spiked coral tendrils.  

## Abilities & Traits  
- **Tidal Behemoth** – Rhyzmare’s body is both liquid and solid, allowing it to reform and flow through barriers.  
- **Depthless Endurance** – It is impervious to exhaustion, pressure, and temperature, thriving in any environment.  
- **Abyssal Pull** – Its presence warps the currents, dragging ships and creatures toward its immense form.  
- **Crushing Undertow** – With a single motion, it can summon massive whirlpools capable of swallowing entire armadas.  
- **Primordial Resurgence** – Destroying Rhyzmare is impossible; even if shattered, it will reform from the ocean's depths.  

## Temperament & Behavior  
Rhyzmare does not seek war, but it does not shy away from destruction. It moves with the patience of the tides, observing the world through eyes as ancient as the sea itself. When provoked, it retaliates with overwhelming force, unleashing waves that reshape coastlines and drown civilizations.

## The Mystery of Rhyzmare  
Some scholars believe Rhyzmare is tied to the ocean’s very soul, an entity that awakens when the balance of the seas is disturbed. Others claim it guards something deep beneath the waves—an ancient secret buried in the abyss. What is certain is that no force has ever truly vanquished Rhyzmare; it is not a being to be slain, but a force to be endured.
