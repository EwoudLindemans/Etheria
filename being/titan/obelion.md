# Obelion – The Arcane Bastion  
"The earth quakes at its approach, the air hums with raw power. It is not a mere construct—it is a force beyond mortal comprehension."

## Origins & Legend  
No one knows who created Obelion or why it exists. Some say it was forged by an ancient civilization as a guardian of forgotten knowledge, while others believe it emerged from the fabric of reality itself, a manifestation of the world's untapped magical forces. What is certain is that Obelion does not belong to any single era—it has always been, watching, waiting, and reshaping the land with every step.

## Physical Description  
- **Height:** 100+ feet, towering over mountains  
- **Weight:** Immeasurable, bound to the very bedrock of the world  
- **Appearance:** An asymmetrical fusion of **stone, metal, and glowing arcane energy**. Some parts of its body resemble ruined towers, while others shift like molten rock. Its core pulsates with cryptic symbols, constantly shifting in an undecipherable pattern.  
- **Eyes:** A singular, massive eye at the center of its shifting mass, radiating an eerie, color-shifting glow.  
- **Limbs & Structure:** Jagged and irregular, with limbs that reform as needed. Some parts appear mechanical, while others seem to be sculpted by nature itself.  

## Abilities & Traits  
- **Titanic Arcana** – Obelion is a living conduit of magical energy, capable of warping reality around itself.  
- **Adaptive Form** – Its body shifts and reshapes mid-combat, making it nearly impossible to predict its movements.  
- **Void-Forged Resilience** – Physical attacks barely leave a mark, as its structure continuously repairs itself.  
- **Arcane Singularity** – Obelion can manipulate gravitational forces, pulling in or repelling enemies at will.  
- **Worldshatter Pulse** – A devastating discharge of raw energy that fractures the very fabric of the battlefield.  

## Temperament & Behavior  
Obelion does not act with malice or purpose—it simply exists. It does not communicate, nor does it acknowledge worship or defiance. Some believe it is following an ancient directive, one that no living being can comprehend. Others speculate that it is searching for something, though what that might be remains a mystery.

## The Mystery of Obelion  
Scholars and mages alike have attempted to decipher the sigils that dance across Obelion’s body, but no known language matches their form. Some claim it is a record of an era before recorded history, while others fear that unlocking its secrets may awaken something even more dangerous than the titan itself.
