# Gor’Thuun – The Verdant Titan
"The roots of the world entwine with its limbs, the winds whisper its name. It does not battle for conquest—it fights as the guardian of life itself."

## Origins & Legend
Gor’Thuun is an ancient titan woven from the essence of nature itself, a living colossus of bark, vine, and stone. It is said to have been formed when the primordial forests first took root, a guardian birthed from the will of the world. When the balance of nature is threatened, Gor’Thuun stirs from its slumber, bringing the wrath of the wilds upon those who dare defile the land.

## Physical Description
- **Height:** 18 to 25 feet tall  
- **Weight:** Thousands of pounds, composed of ancient wood, moss-covered stone, and entwined vines  
- **Appearance:** A massive, humanoid entity with bark-like plating that shifts like armor, vines that twist and pulse with green energy, and antler-like branches that stretch from its crown. Flowers bloom and wither along its body with the turning of the seasons.  
- **Eyes:** Deep pools of emerald light, radiating wisdom and the untamed force of nature.  
- **Limbs:** Thick, root-entwined arms that can reshape into massive claws, crushing vines, or sweeping branches.  

## Abilities & Traits
- **Colossal Strength** – Gor’Thuun wields the raw power of nature, uprooting trees and hurling boulders with ease.  
- **Living Bastion** – Its body is resilient like ancient oak, resistant to most physical harm.  
- **Verdant Stride** – With each step, flora surges forth, reshaping the battlefield in its favor.  
- **Primordial Regeneration** – As long as it stands upon natural ground, Gor’Thuun slowly mends its wounds.  
- **Wrath of the Wilds** – When enraged, it can summon a storm of thorns, vines, and gale-force winds to lay waste to its foes.  

## Temperament & Behavior
Though a being of immense power, Gor’Thuun is not an aggressor. It moves with slow, deliberate purpose, acting only when nature is in peril. It observes the world with an ageless patience, yet when provoked, its fury is as relentless as a hurricane.

## The Mystery of Gor’Thuun
Some believe Gor’Thuun is the last remnant of an ancient age when nature ruled supreme, waiting for a time when the balance is truly lost. Others whisper of a hidden grove where it slumbers, its roots entwined with the heart of the world. It is said that those who seek the wisdom of the ancients may find answers within its emerald gaze—but only if they prove themselves worthy.
