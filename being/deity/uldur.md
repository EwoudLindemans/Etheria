# Uldur
**Uldur: The Deity of Balance and Earth**

**Concept & Fantasy Twist:**
Uldur is a revered deity in the setting, known as the god of **Balance** and **Earth**, embodying both the creation and preservation of life through natural forces. He is worshipped by various groups, including the Concordium Medica healers and the Mudshaper Ogres, who see him as a source of their respective crafts.

- **Healers' Perspective:** To the Tiefling healers of the Concordium Medica, Uldur represents the balance between life and consequence. They seek his guidance to restore health while maintaining cosmic order, viewing him as a divine force that ensures every healing act serves a greater purpose.

- **Mudshapers' Perspective:** For the Ogre Mudshapers, Uldur is the deity who grants them the ability to breathe life into clay and earth. They believe his divine power allows them to create living structures and golems, seeing him as the source of their artistic craftsmanship and earth magic.
