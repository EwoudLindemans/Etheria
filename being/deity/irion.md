# Irion, The Fallen Titan
*Deity of Cataclysm, Transformation, and Arcane Genesis*  
![irion.png](/world/irion.png =500x)

The creature that collapsed with the world [Etheria](/i/15) is called Irion. The origin of Irion is unknown, but there are many theories about what it may be. Some say that it is a dragon that was petrified by powerful magic, while others say that it is a giant creature created by the gods. Whatever the truth may be, Irion remains a mystery and its impact on the world is still felt today.

Irion is not a god in the traditional sense, but rather a primordial force—an entity whose fall reshaped the very fabric of Etheria. Some revere it as a divine being, others as an eldritch aberration beyond mortal comprehension. Regardless of perspective, its presence is undeniable, lingering in the very essence of the world it shattered. Irion is both destroyer and creator, its Residue the foundation upon which new magic and life have flourished.  

## Residue
With time Etheria healed through the magical residue that the creature left behind.
The magical essence of the creature is what gives Etheria its unique properties. It is a world that is alive and constantly changing. The land itself is alive and has a will of its own. The rivers flow with magical energy, and the trees grow to impossible heights. Even the air itself is thick with magic. It is a world that is in constant flux, and it is this magic that makes the connection between Iron en Etheria so special.

## **Manifestation and Symbols:**  
- Irion is depicted as a **colossal, half-spectral being**, its form entombed within the world itself.  
- Its eyes, are said to glow faintly with lingering arcane energy, staring into the void beyond time.  
- Its body is a fusion of **crystalline scales, fossilized flesh, and veins of liquid magic**, exuding an aura of both destruction and renewal.  
- Its sigil is **a broken circle with tendrils of energy spilling forth**, symbolizing the Collapse and the unchecked flow of magic that followed.  

## **Doctrine and Influence:**  
- **Destruction begets creation.** The world as it is now exists because of what was lost.  
- **Magic is chaos given form.** The energy of Etheria is Irion’s gift, but it is neither benevolent nor malevolent—it simply *is*.  
- **Nothing is immutable.** Stone becomes dust, rivers shift their course, and life adapts. Those who resist change are doomed to crumble.  
- **The Residue is the lifeblood of Etheria.** To harness it is to wield the raw power of creation itself.  

## **Effect on Etheria:**  
The Collapse was not merely a catastrophe—it was a transformation. The impact of Irion’s fall infused Etheria with volatile magical essence, shaping a world that is alive, unpredictable, and inextricably tied to the creature’s lingering power. This Residue seeps into every element of life, warping landscapes, birthing impossible flora and fauna, and granting the denizens of Etheria an innate connection to magic.  

In some places, Irion’s petrified remains still protrude from the earth, vast and unmoving, worshipped by those who see divinity in its form. Temples and research sanctums alike are built upon these sites, seeking to understand or exploit the lingering essence. Some whisper that Irion is not truly dead—that it dreams beneath the surface, its consciousness scattered through the Residue, waiting for the day it might rise again.  

Whatever the truth may be, Etheria will never be free of Irion’s influence. Its fall marked the beginning of a new era—one where magic and matter are forever entwined, and where the echoes of a titan’s descent still shape the fate of all who walk its surface.  

## Events
- [The Collapse](/i/17) is the event where Irion collapsed with a planet, now named Etheria
