## Fracture Link  
*A stable resonance between selves across the fractured weave*

**Fracture Link** is a rare magical phenomenon where two beings resonate across identities. In most cases, a Fracture Link forms between a person and their **alter-echo**—a version of themselves shaped by divergent choices or unstable magic. However, in exceptional instances a Fracture Link may form between two individuals who jointly interacted with a resonant artifact, like the **Shard of the Fracture Keep**, or participated in the creation of a convergence being like **[Vexyrra](/being/deity/vexyrra.md)**.

A Fracture Link is **predictable, stable, and reciprocal**. It is not emotional. It is resonance—measurable and manipulable. Those linked can detect each other’s magical frequency across short distances, harmonize their spellwork, and even combine magic into new hybrid effects.

### Mechanics of a Fracture Link

- **Resonant Awareness**  
  Linked individuals are aware of each other's magical resonance when within **120 feet**. This awareness is like a tone sensed in the mind—a distinct magical “signature”—allowing them to track, time, and coordinate actions without speech.

- **Spell Harmonization** *(usable once per short rest)*  
  If both linked casters cast a spell on the same turn, and the spell level matches, the effects may be **combined** into a unified result. Examples:
  - Two *Fireballs* become one massive wave with increased radius or altered damage type.
  - A *Song of Rest* + *Shield* might protect all allies within the bard’s aura while reinforcing one target.
  - *Dispel Magic* + *Counterspell* may affect ongoing enchantments and active casting at once.

- **Split Casting**  
  A linked caster may begin casting a spell (1 action) and the other may complete it (1 reaction or bonus action), provided they are within range and both know the spell. This allows staggering powerful effects or splitting concentration burden.

- **Link Surge** *(optional variant rule)*  
  When both are within **30 feet**, and one casts a spell of 3rd level or higher, the other may choose to **feed a spell slot** into the casting. This increases potency, range, or secondary effects depending on the nature of the spell.

### Risks and Limits
- Only **one Fracture Link** may be maintained at a time.
- Both casters must have touched a resonant object or participated in a qualifying convergence event.
- Harmonization fails if either participant is unconscious, silenced, or within an antimagic field.

### Theoretical Implications
Some scholars believe Fracture Links may be key to understanding the deeper structure of the fractured weave—how resonance flows not only between places and scales, but between possible selves. The more stable the link, the closer a being may draw toward convergence with their potential forms. The link might be more than just between echoes.

Fracture Links are studied, measured, and monitored by arcane theorists across Etheria—but few can replicate one without risking collapse. They remain rare, powerful, and deeply entwined with the events of the Mirrorstep.
