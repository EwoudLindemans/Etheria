# The Deities and the Will of Iridia
Deities in [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) are [manifestations](/structure/chronological/event/manifestation.md) of collective belief, embodying the desires, fears, and values of the people. Each [Scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) supports one deity at a time, but belief is fluid—deities may fade, migrate, or be replaced. However, they leave behind **imprints**, [resonances](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) of their past influence, allowing for their potential return if faith realigns. The borders of each Scale shift in response to changing beliefs, ensuring a dynamic divine balance.

When a deity weakens, it does not vanish entirely but lingers as an imprint. If belief later realigns with its essence, the deity may return without needing to be recreated. For example, a Deity of Protection may fade in times of peace, giving way to a Deity of Prosperity, only to reawaken when war rekindles the need for protection.

Some deities in [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) fight relentlessly to maintain their power, using conduits, and even conflict to keep faith alive. Others manipulate belief by merging with rival domains or altering their own nature to remain relevant. However, some deities are more passive, relying on deeply rooted traditions or ancient temples to sustain their presence. A few accept their decline entirely, fading into imprints or drifting until belief calls them back. While no deity is ever truly gone, their survival depends on how far they are willing to fight for their people.

## Resonance Drift
A deity is not bound permanently to a [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) and may drift to another scale if it becomes more aligned with its essence. However, migration can only occur after the current deity weakens. In some cases, multiple deities may compete for a scale, engaging in a **struggle for dominance** until the strongest faith prevails. If a deity senses greater belief elsewhere, it may choose to abandon its current scale in search of a new home. This process can even happen for imprinted deities

## Resonance Convergence
When no existing deity fully embodies the **will** of the people, a **new deity emerges**. This process begins as a new resonating thread, triggered by a subtle shift in people's **will** that grows stronger until the new domain(s) are significant enough, the thread **will** then embody the collective **will** of the people.

## Resonance Fade
Deities in [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md) are never truly lost. However they can linger as a imprint or drift to another [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md), When faith declines, a deity weakens and dissolves into this latent state. Yet, these imprints preserve their essence, allowing for potential rebirth or reactivation if belief resurges. Some deities reawaken after years or even centuries, while others seek or are pulled to new scales.

## Resonance Conduits
Certain individuals, known as **Echo-Bearers**, act as [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) conduits, extending a deity’s influence beyond its home [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md). Though they do not wield divine power themselves, they serve as crucial anchors, preserving the deity’s presence across distant lands.

## Resonance Weave
In regions where neighboring [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) overlap, the domains of deities may merge or influence one another, creating blended divine [manifestations](/structure/chronological/event/manifestation.md). 

For example, in a contested area where a Deity of War and a Deity of Strategy exert influence, their combined presence might give rise to a unique Deity of Tactics—one that embodies both martial prowess and calculated warfare.

## Irion’s Will
At the heart of [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md)’s divine order lies [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)’s Will, the guiding force that governs the pace of divine transitions. No deity is ever truly permanent, nor is any deity ever completely gone. Irion’s Will prevents sudden rises or collapses, ensuring that only deep and widespread faith can bring about lasting change.

However, in times of upheaval—whether caused by war, disaster, or revolution—the balance may shift rapidly. [Scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) tip, faith surges, and new divine forces emerge to reshape [Iridia](/geography/world/iridia.md), all while maintaining the cosmic equilibrium that defines the world.
