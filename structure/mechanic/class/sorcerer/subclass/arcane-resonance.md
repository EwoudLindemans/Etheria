# Arcane Resonance
*Sorcerer Subclass*

Some Sorcerers begin their journey as aspiring Wizards, driven by a thirst for knowledge and the belief that [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) is a discipline to be learned. They study ancient tomes, memorize spells, and refine their craft with the precision of a scholar, unaware of the power that stirs within them.

But as they delve deeper into the arcane, they begin to notice something strange. Their [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) feels different—less like a learned skill and more like an instinctive force. The spells they cast no longer require the careful preparation of words and gestures; instead, magic flows through them naturally, resonating with their very being.

Over time, these individuals come to realize that they are not simply studying [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md)—they are Sorcerers, born with a deep, innate connection to the fundamental frequencies of the universe. Their magic is not learned but awakened, flowing through them as part of who they are, shaping reality with harmonic [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md).

## Level 3: Resonant Affinity
At 3th level, your connection to the forces of [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) allows you to resonate yourself with the underlying fabric of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md). At the end of a long rest, you can attune yourself to one of the following resonances.

- **Resonant Fracture:**
  - When you cast a spell using a high-level spell slot, you can choose to fracture the spell’s power. By expending the high-level spell slot, you cast the spell at half the original spell slot level (rounded down). You then regain a spell slot of the new, lower level for future use.
    - **For even-level spell slots**, you divide the level by 2 (e.g., 8th-level becomes 4th-level).
    - **For odd-level spell slots**, subtract 1 from the spell level before dividing by 2 (e.g., 9th-level becomes 4th-level, 7th-level becomes 3rd-level).
  - The spell slot regained is marked as fractured and cannot be divided again.

---

- **Resonant Harmonics:**
  - When you cast a spell that requires concentration, you can maintain concentration without making concentration checks for 2 rounds.
  - Spells you cast have no verbal or somatic components—they manifest instinctively. You don’t need to speak or gesture to cast them.
  - Once per long rest, you can leave behind a magical "Echo" when you cast a spell. This Echo allows you to recast the same spell as a Bonus Action without expending a spell slot. The Echo lasts for 1 minute.

---

- **Disruptive [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md):**
  - When a creature within 30 feet of you casts a spell, you can use your reaction to attempt to destabilize the [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md). Roll an Arcana check against the creature's spell save DC. On a success, the spell fails, and the caster loses the spell slot.
  - Your spells cannot be countered or dispelled unless the caster succeeds on a spellcasting ability check against your spell save DC.

---

- **Resonant Echo's:**
  - When you cast a spell, you can choose to expend additional spell slots to create echoes of that spell. Each echo casts at the level of the expended spell slot and at half potency for damage and healing spells. For other spells, the effects are fully functional. (Up to a maximum of 4)
  - **Exhaustion:** If you expend more than 2 spell slots in a single turn, you gain one level of exhaustion due to the strain of channeling so much [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) at once.



## Level 6: Resonant Adaptation
By 6th level, you have gained the ability to more easily shift between the [resonances](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) that govern your [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md). You can change your Resonant in the following ways:

- **Meditation:** Once per long rest, you can spend 1 minute meditating to shift your active [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) to another one you have already chosen.
- **Magical Field Awareness:** You can make an *Arcana* check (DC 15) to instantly shift to a new [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) when exposed to strong magical fields, such as ley lines, enchanted artifacts, or Rift events.
- **Resonant Resistance:** You gain resistance to force damage and any damage caused by magical effects that push, pull, or restrain you (such as the *telekinesis* spell or *wall of force*).

## Level 10: Liminal State
At 10th level, your connection to the [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) frequencies becomes so deep that you can momentarily slip between the boundaries of physical reality. You can enter a **Liminal State** for 1 minute, once per long rest. During this time, the following occurs:

- **Resonant Protection:** You gain resistance to all magical damage from spells and effects.
- **Phasing Through Reality:** You can move through non-magical barriers (such as walls, doors, or windows) as if you were incorporeal. You can pass through creatures as well, though you can't end your movement inside one.
- **Energy Absorption:** If you take damage from a spell, you can convert half of that damage into temporary hit points.

Additionally, while in the Liminal State, enemy spells that target you have disadvantage to hit you if they require an attack roll, and you can avoid the effects of harmful spells with a successful *Constitution saving throw* against the caster's spell save DC.

## Level 14: Perfect Resonance
At 14th level, you have mastered the flow of [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md), allowing you to simultaneously channel multiple frequencies at once. You gain the following benefits:

### Dual Resonance
You can attune yourself to two [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Frequencies at once. The benefits of both Frequencies apply simultaneously while you maintain them, allowing you to blend their effects. For example, you could be in both **Harmonic Flow** and **Disruptive Wave** at once, sustaining spells and disrupting enemy casters.

### Resonant Absorption
When you take damage from a spell, you can harmonize with the energy and convert it into [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md). The next spell you cast within 1 minute gains a special bonus effect based on the damage type you absorbed:

- **Fire Damage:** Your next spell deals extra fire damage equal to your Sorcerer level.
- **Cold Damage:** You gain temporary hit points equal to half of the cold damage absorbed.
- **Lightning Damage:** Your next spell gains an additional charge, allowing you to cast it twice at once if it’s a spell with a casting time of *1 action* (does not apply to spells with a *Concentration* duration).
- **Psychic Damage:** Your next spell deals psychic damage and gains advantage on any saving throws to maintain concentration.

## Resonance Sorcerer in Action
The **Arcane [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md)** subclass allows for an incredibly flexible and dynamic playstyle, giving Sorcerers the ability to adapt, disrupt, and augment their magical abilities in ways that no other subclass can. Whether you want to manipulate the flow of your spells, counter your enemies’ [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), or absorb energy to bolster your own abilities, this subclass provides rich and diverse options.

By 14th level, you'll be able to manipulate multiple frequencies, creating a very fluid and responsive form of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) that [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) up with the complexity of gameplay. The flavor and thematics of "[resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md)" are tightly tied to both the mechanics and the roleplay of this subclass.

## Summary of Key Features:
- **Level 1:** Choose a [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) that enhances your spellcasting in different ways, such as no verbal/somatic components, disrupting enemy spells, or duplicating your [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md).
- **Level 6:** Shift between [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Frequencies more easily, gaining resistance to force damage and effects that manipulate you.
- **Level 10:** Enter a Liminal State to gain resistance to magical damage, phase through barriers, and absorb spell damage for temporary hit points.
- **Level 14:** Harmonize with multiple [Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Frequencies at once and absorb energy from spells to enhance your own [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md).
