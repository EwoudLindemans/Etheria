# **Karmic Slap**

<audio controls="1" controlslist="noplaybackrate" src="/music/karmic_slap.mp3"></audio>

**Description:**
The universe (or fate) strikes back when players act in selfish, reckless, or morally questionable ways. The **Karmic Slap** is a consequence for actions that harm others, betray trust, or otherwise violate moral expectations. It represents the immediate reflection of one's actions, and the consequences can be severe.

---

### **Triggering the Slap:**
The **Karmic Slap** condition is triggered when a player causes harm, chaos, or acts in a morally dubious way (e.g., attacking an unarmed enemy, betraying an ally, causing unnecessary destruction). The Dungeon Master may declare the **Karmic Slap** when an action is deemed selfish or excessive in nature.

---

### **Effect:**
Once triggered, the player must roll a **d6** (or larger die, depending on the severity desired). The results are as follows:

- **1-2: Immediate Backlash:**  
  The character is affected by their own reckless behavior. This might include hurting themselves, triggering a trap they missed, or a spell backfiring. The player takes **half the damage** they intended to deal to their target (rounded up).
  
- **3-4: Reflection:**  
  The character experiences the consequences of their actions. They suffer **disadvantage** on their next roll or ability check, as the universe gives them a chance to reflect and reconsider their choices.

- **5-6: Cosmic Reprisal:**  
  The character faces severe karmic consequences. This could mean an NPC they wronged comes back with vengeance, a natural disaster interrupts their plans, or an ally turns on them. The **Karmic Slap** results in an **effect as impactful (or more so) as the original wrong act**.

---

### **Additional Mechanics:**

- **Karmic Insight:**  
  After triggering a **Karmic Slap**, the player may choose to **reflect** on their actions. This takes 10 minutes in-game to meditate and gain clarity. Upon reflection, the player gains **advantage on their next Wisdom or Charisma-based check** or a **+1 bonus** to their next roll.

- **Redemption:**  
  If a player can **redeem** themselves (e.g., righting the wrong or making a sacrifice), they can **clear the Karmic Slap condition**, removing any lingering consequences.

---

The **Karmic Slap** mechanic encourages players to make thoughtful, morally-aware decisions, while providing them with the opportunity to learn and grow from their mistakes.
