# Paradoxical Recoil  

## Description  
Paradoxical Recoil is a supernatural or psychological condition that causes actions to frequently result in unintended, opposite, or wildly unpredictable consequences. Those afflicted find that fate itself plays tricks on them, warping reality when they least expect it.  

## Fate-Twinned Roll Mechanic  
Whenever a creature with Paradoxical Recoil makes an **attack roll, ability check, or saving throw**, they must **roll two d20s instead of one** and take the higher result.  

- **If both dice land on the same number**, reality distorts, and the effect is determined by the table below.

## **Paradoxical Recoil Effect Table**  

| Double Roll | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| **1 & 1**  | **Fool’s Fortune** – Instead of a critical failure, this counts as a **natural 20**. However, the success is so extreme that it causes **unexpected consequences** (e.g., unlocking a door also unlocks all cells in a dungeon). |
| **2 & 2**  | **Divine Trickery** – The roll succeeds, but a **random deity, fey, or supernatural entity** takes interest in the character, marking them for future interference. |
| **3 & 3**  | **Karmic Bounce** – The roll fails, but another event in the world **shifts in the character’s favor** (e.g., failing to sneak past guards, but another distraction pulls them away). |
| **4 & 4**  | **Delayed Reversal** – The roll succeeds now, but **within the next 24 hours, the universe will take something else away in return** (DM’s choice). |
| **5 & 5**  | **Mundane Madness** – The roll works, but something minor **goes bizarrely wrong** (e.g., your sword works perfectly, but your boots suddenly untie themselves). |
| **6 & 6**  | **Echo of Fate** – The next time the character makes this type of check (attack, skill, or save), they must **reroll two d20s again** regardless of whether Paradoxical Recoil is cured. |
| **7 & 7**  | **False Confidence** – The roll appears to succeed, but **the character won’t realize the failure until it’s too late** (e.g., they think they disable a trap, but it actually triggers when stepped on). |
| **8 & 8**  | **Reality Glitch** – The action completes, but something **unrelated randomly changes** (e.g., the Rogue picks a lock, but suddenly their hair turns bright blue). |
| **9 & 9**  | **The Unseen Hand** – A mysterious force **nudges the outcome slightly**, causing an unintended side effect (e.g., an arrow bends in flight, hitting the wrong target). |
| **10 & 10** | **Quantum Stumble** – The action works, but the character **teleports 5 feet in a random direction** immediately afterward. |
| **11 & 11** | **Parallel Outcome** – The roll’s outcome **affects someone else nearby instead of the intended target** (e.g., casting *Cure Wounds* on an ally accidentally heals an enemy). |
| **12 & 12** | **Cosmic Echo** – The **exact same scenario** will happen again in the near future, as if reality is on a loop (DM will determine when). |
| **13 & 13** | **Lost in the Moment** – The action works, but **the character briefly forgets what just happened** and has no memory of what they did for the last few seconds. |
| **14 & 14** | **Time Skip** – The action completes, but **1d6 seconds are mysteriously skipped**, making it unclear what happened during that time. |
| **15 & 15** | **Opposing Will** – A hidden cosmic force resists the action, and the character must **reroll the check** normally without Paradoxical Recoil’s effect. |
| **16 & 16** | **Energy Surge** – The roll succeeds, and the character **gains temporary magical energy**, causing their next action to have **advantage**. |
| **17 & 17** | **Destiny’s Favor** – The roll succeeds, and the character is granted **one free reroll** to use anytime in the next hour. |
| **18 & 18** | **Perfect Execution** – The roll succeeds **so well** that it creates an **additional positive effect** (e.g., not just sneaking past a guard, but stealing their key while doing so). |
| **19 & 19** | **Miraculous Luck** – Not only does the roll succeed, but **the next failed roll the character makes is automatically turned into a success**. |
| **20 & 20** | **Divine Rejection** – Instead of a critical success, this counts as a **natural 1**, as the universe itself resists the action. The failure should be **catastrophic**, often leading to unintended disaster. |

## **Escalating Chaos**  
If the creature triggers **Paradoxical Recoil three times in a row**, the DM introduces a **major plot-altering event**—this could be a divine omen, a rip in reality, or a change in fate itself.  

## **Curing the Condition**  
Paradoxical Recoil can be removed by:  
- A *Greater Restoration* spell  
- A successful **DC 18 Wisdom (Insight) check** after a long rest, as the creature mentally overcomes their chaotic misfortune  
- Breaking a powerful magical curse or completing a fate-altering event determined by the DM  

---

## **DM Notes**  
Paradoxical Recoil is best used as a **temporary affliction** to add tension, comedy, or narrative twists. It works well for cursed items, mischievous fey magic, or divine trickery from chaotic deities. The **Fate-Twinned Roll** ensures that at any moment, the player could experience something they **never expected—good or bad.**  

# 1. The Balanced Path (Careful Mechanic)  
📜 *For those who seek stability in an unpredictable world.*  

## **Mechanic:**  
- When rolling an **attack, ability check, or saving throw**, roll **two d20s**.  
- Choose the result **closest to 10** (favoring the lower number in a tie).  

## **Effect:**  
- Reduces extreme **failures** and **successes**, keeping rolls near **the middle range (8-12)**.  
- Perfect for **strategic, careful characters** who prefer **consistent results** over chaos.  
- Makes **nat 1s and nat 20s far less likely**, ensuring fewer catastrophic failures.  

## **Average Roll:**  
- **Expected value: ~10.5** (compared to a standard d20 average of **10.5**).  
- Rolls tend to **cluster around 8-12**, reducing variability.  

## **Example:**  
- You roll **a 5 and a 15** → You take **the 15** (closer to 10).  
- You roll **a 3 and a 17** → You take **the 3** (closer to 10).  
- You roll **a 10 and a 14** → You take **the 10** (exact middle).  

🎭 *Best for: Strategic thinkers, scholars, monks, and those who fear the chaos of fate.*

# 2. The Path of Legends (Epic Mechanic)  
🔥 *For those who embrace the extremes of fate.*  

## **Mechanic:**  
- When rolling an **attack, ability check, or saving throw**, roll **two d20s**.  
- Choose the result **furthest from 10** (favoring the higher number in a tie).  

## **Effect:**  
- Increases the chance of **critical successes** *and* **catastrophic failures**.  
- Ideal for **high-risk, high-reward** characters who **thrive on chaos**.  
- Drastically **reduces middle-of-the-road rolls**—you either **soar or crash.**  

## **Average Roll:**  
- Rolls tend to **cluster around two peaks: 1-5 and 15-20**, avoiding middle values.  
- **Split averages:**  
  - **Lower half (1-10):** Expected average ~**4.5**  
  - **Upper half (11-20):** Expected average ~**16.5**  

## **Example:**  
- You roll **a 5 and a 15** → You take **the 5** (furthest from 10).  
- You roll **a 3 and a 17** → You take **the 17** (furthest from 10).  
- You roll **a 10 and a 14** → You take **the 14** (higher of the tie).  

⚡ *Best for: Wild warriors, reckless gamblers, chosen heroes, and those who defy fate itself.*
