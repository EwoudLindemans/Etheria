# Carefull Roll
ðŸ“œ *For those who seek stability in an unpredictable world.*  

## **Mechanic:**  
- When rolling an **attack, ability check, or saving throw**, roll **two d20s**.  
- Choose the result **closest to 10** (averaging the number in a tie).  

## **Effect:**  
- Reduces extreme **failures** and **successes**, keeping rolls near **the middle range (8-12)**.  
- Perfect for **strategic, careful characters** who prefer **consistent results** over chaos.  
- Makes **nat 1s and nat 20s far less likely**, ensuring fewer catastrophic failures.  

## **Average Roll:**  
- **Expected value: ~10.5** (compared to a standard d20 average of **10.5**).  
- Rolls tend to **cluster around 8-12**, reducing variability.  

## **Example:**  
- You roll **a 5 and a 15** â†’ You take **the 15** (closer to 10).  
- You roll **a 3 and a 17** â†’ You take **the 3** (closer to 10).  
- You roll **a 10 and a 14** â†’ You take **the 10** (exact middle).  

ðŸŽ­ *Best for: Strategic thinkers, scholars, monks, and those who fear the chaos of fate.*
