*"Glass is more than sand and heat. It is light given form, fire made eternal, and memory trapped in crystal."*

The **[Emberglass](/raw/20250501/emberglass/emberglass.md) Artisans** are Dragonborn artisans who wield fire and [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) to shape glass into objects of beauty, power, and remembrance. Their craft is more than simple glassblowing—it is an ancient art passed down through generations, a sacred duty to preserve history and illuminate the future. Their mirrors reflect more than just faces, their jewels pulse with captured energy, and their memory-glass holds [echoes](/raw/20250501/soul/echoes.md) of lost voices.

A true [Emberglass](/raw/20250501/emberglass/emberglass.md) Artisan does not just create; they bind fire, shape light, and forge stories into glass.

## The Four Paths of Emberglass Artisans

### **1. Emberglass Memory Artisans – Keepers of Memory**  
*"What is lost need not be forgotten."*  
The most traditional and revered among their kind, [Emberglass](/raw/20250501/emberglass/emberglass.md) Artisans **embed memories** into their creations. They preserve the last words of the dying, the wisdom of scholars, and the emotions of those long passed. Their work ensures that history is never lost and that voices of the past may still be heard.

### **2. Emberglass Hexfire Artisans – Crafters of the Doomed**  
*"Beware the gift of a Hexfire Artisan; its price is paid in suffering."*  
These twisted artisans **trap curses within [emberglass](/raw/20250501/emberglass/emberglass.md)**, creating objects of misfortune and ruin. A cursed mirror may show a person’s worst fears, a pendant may leech away strength, and a lantern may burn only for those doomed to die. Hexfire Artisans are feared, sought after only by those desperate enough to wield their wicked craft.

### **3. Emberglass Graveflame Artisans – Harbingers of the Bound**  
*"Flame fades, but [souls](/raw/20250501/soul/soul.md) linger."*  
The darkest of their order, Graveflame Artisans **imprison [souls](/raw/20250501/soul/soul.md) within [emberglass](/raw/20250501/emberglass/emberglass.md)**. Their orbs can be used to raise the dead, whisper forgotten knowledge, or serve as vessels for trapped spirits. Some wield these artifacts as necromantic tools, while others believe they grant the departed a second chance to influence the world of the living.

### **4. Emberglass Ashenfang Artisans – Weavers of the Unquiet Dead**  
*"Fire may cleanse, but embers smolder still."*  
Where Graveflame Artisans imprison [souls](/raw/20250501/soul/soul.md), **[Ashenfang](/structure/society/clan/ashenfang.md) Artisans bind them into form**. Masters of the lingering energies between life and death, they craft **boneglass constructs**, ember-eyed specters, and **flickering revenants**, shaping the [undead](/raw/20250501/undead/undead.md) as artisans sculpt clay. Unlike crude necromancers who simply raise corpses, Ashenfang Artisans imbue their creations with purpose—whether as guardians, messengers, or cursed relics that whisper secrets from beyond the grave.

Their most feared works are the **Hollowflame Effigies**, statues of [emberglass](/raw/20250501/emberglass/emberglass.md) and ash that, when shattered, release the bound dead in a final burst of spectral wrath.

## The Legend of Izzar’Vharr, the First Artisan

*"Fire is destruction. Fire is creation. I shall teach you both."*

Long ago, when Dragonborn still lived under the rule of elder dragons, there was one who refused to let knowledge fade—**Izzar’Vharr, the First Artisan**. He was no warrior, no sorcerer, but a maker, a guardian of stories. As his people waged war and cities crumbled, he sought a way to preserve history beyond books and stone.

He discovered that with dragonfire and the right minerals, he could create something unbreakable: **[Emberglass](/raw/20250501/emberglass/emberglass.md)**, a rare, enchanted glass that could store images, words, even memories. He fashioned the first **Moonlit Mirror**, which showed the truth of things—revealing hidden thoughts, secret fears, and even glimpses of fate. He crafted the **Soulglass Orbs**, which held the voices of lost elders so they might never be forgotten.

Izzar’Vharr's creations spread across the land, coveted by kings, scholars, and warlords alike. But his greatest masterpiece, the **Eternal Prism**, a perfect crystal said to hold the wisdom of a thousand lifetimes, was lost to time. Some say it shattered, its pieces hidden in the works of [Emberglass](/raw/20250501/emberglass/emberglass.md) Artisans to this day. Others believe it still waits to be found, glowing in the darkest corners of the world.

The **[Emberglass](/raw/20250501/emberglass/emberglass.md) Artisans** see themselves as his successors, continuing his work so that no knowledge, no beauty, and no [soul](/raw/20250501/soul/soul.md) is ever truly lost.

## The Ways of the Emberglass Artisans

### Forging the Flameglass
Creating [Emberglass](/raw/20250501/emberglass/emberglass.md) is no simple task. It begins with the gathering of **rare sands**—some from volcanic shores, others from the depths of the desert, and the rarest, from the bones of fallen dragons. These materials are melted with **dragonfire breath**, infused with [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), and shaped through both precision and instinct.

The result is not ordinary glass, but something **alive**—glass that holds light within it, that shimmers like dragon [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md), that remembers the touch of those who wield it.

## The Signature Creations of the Emberglass Artisans

### **Moonlit Mirrors**  
*"A mirror that does not lie."*  
Crafted from the purest [Emberglass](/raw/20250501/emberglass/emberglass.md), these mirrors reveal more than just reflections. They can show hidden truths, uncover illusions, and even capture fleeting visions of the past or future. Some rulers and nobles refuse to stand before one, fearing what may be revealed.

### **Emberglass Orbs**  
*"Voices of the past, never silenced."*  
Each [emberglass](/raw/20250501/emberglass/emberglass.md) orb is imbued with the essence of a person’s memory, preserving their words, emotions, or even a fragment of their [soul](/raw/20250501/soul/soul.md). Used by scholars, oracles, and grieving families, they ensure that knowledge and love do not fade with time.

### **Dragon’s Eye Jewels**  
*"A jewel that sees."*  
These flawless [gemstones](/raw/20250504/gem/gemstones.md) hold a sliver of flame within them. Some act as magical focuses, enhancing a wearer’s spells. Others are said to allow glimpses of unseen things—hidden doors, disguised foes, or even spirits wandering the veil between life and death.

### **Runewrought Lenses**  
*"The world seen through fire."*  
These finely cut glass lenses are inscribed with draconic runes, granting the wearer enhanced vision, the ability to see [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), or even to read lost scripts. Some thieves and spies seek these lenses for more illicit purposes.

### **The Everflame Lantern**  
*"A light that never dies."*  
A relic of old, these lanterns burn with a glass-encased fire that never extinguishes, even underwater or in magical darkness. They serve as guiding beacons, carried by travelers, warriors, and those who guard sacred places.

### **The Fractured Prism**  
*"Each shard holds a different truth."*  
An experimental work, these strange, multi-faceted crystals warp perception, revealing hidden layers of reality. A warrior might see an enemy’s next strike before it lands. A sage might glimpse a hidden riddle within a text. But such power is unpredictable, and some shards show things best left unseen.

## The Role of an Emberglass Shaper
**[Emberglass](/raw/20250501/emberglass/emberglass.md) Shapers** are more than artisans; they are **historians, visionaries, and guardians of memory**. Their work is found in temples, royal halls, arcane towers, and ancient tombs.

Some work openly, selling their wares to nobles and adventurers. Others operate in secrecy, creating mirrors that expose hidden crimes or crafting soulglass to preserve dying last words. A few seek out the lost works of **Izzar’Vharr**, hunting for fragments of the **Eternal Prism** in the hope of unlocking its forgotten wisdom.

To the Dragonborn, an **[Emberglass](/raw/20250501/emberglass/emberglass.md) Shaper** is a keeper of light, ensuring that fire, knowledge, and legacy are never truly extinguished.
