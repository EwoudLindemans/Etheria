# **The Concordium Medica – Keepers of the Sacred Oath**  

*"We do not heal for kindness. We do not mend for gold. Every wound has a cost, and every debt must be paid."*  

The **Concordium Medica** are an **ancient Tiefling order of physicians**, feared and respected in equal measure. Their healing is a **binding contract**, woven into the very fabric of reality. No one is turned away—but no one is healed without consequence.  

To receive their aid, one must **pay the price**—a price **measured by the severity of the wound**. The greater the suffering, the deeper the cost.  

---

## **The Four Pillars of the Concordium**  

### **1. Gift to Knowledge – The Painwrights (Mild Wounds)**  
*"Your suffering is not in vain. It will teach those who follow."*  

For **minor wounds, lingering ailments, and non-fatal injuries**, healing is granted in exchange for **insight**.  

- Every injury mended must be **recorded**—mapped onto parchment, inscribed in bone, or etched into flesh.  
- The healed **carry a sigil** upon their body, marking their pain **until another is saved by the knowledge it provides.**  
- Diseases, poisons, and curses are **documented**, ensuring future healers may **learn from what was suffered.**  

Their symbol is a **white chalk circle**, left upon the skin of every patient—**a temporary mark of their pain’s legacy.**  

---

### **2. Vow of Balance – The Keepers of Promises (Severe Wounds)**  
*"Your body is restored. Now, keep the oath you once cast aside."*  

For **deep wounds, shattered bones, and deadly afflictions**, the patient must **restore a broken vow** before they are healed.  

- **A knight** who fled battle must **return and make amends**.  
- **A betrayer** must seek out those they wronged and **set things right**.  
- **A ruler** who abandoned a promise must **reclaim their word**, or suffer the price of their failure.  

A **sigil of fire** is placed upon the healed—a brand of **glowing infernal script**. Should they **break their promise again**, their body will **betray them.**  

---

### **3. Oath of Neutrality – The Bound Hands (Life-Threatening Wounds)**  
*"If I am to heal you, you must swear to harm no more than balance allows."*  

For **mortal wounds, death’s edge, and irreversible damage**, the healed must **swear an Oath of Neutrality**—ensuring they do not **tip the [scales](/geography/landmark/scale.md) of power unjustly**.  

- A warlord **healed by the Concordium** must **withdraw from battle** for a time equal to their recovery.  
- A noble **restored to life** must vow **never to use their second chance for vengeance**.  
- A soldier, once healed, must **never again raise a blade in anger**.  

To **break the Oath** is to invoke the **Black Recollection**—a curse that **maintains the healing but creates a painfull scar at the place of the injury**  

Those bound by this contract wear **gloves sewn shut at the fingers**, a mark that **only the Concordium may undo.**  

---

### **4. Sacrifice of Potential – The Unseen Toll (For Those Who Disturb the Balance Too Much)**  
*"This healing demands more than blood. It demands a sacrifice of what could have been."*  

For those whose very existence **disrupts the Balance**, whose **power is too great, whose fate is too volatile**, a **greater cost must be paid**.  

The patient must surrender something **irreplaceable**—a piece of themselves, a thread of their destiny, an artifact of their [soul](/raw/20250501/soul/soul.md).  

- A **memory** of love, lost forever.  
- A **magical talent**, burned away.  
- A **future triumph**, never to come to pass.  
- A **precious heirloom**, consumed in infernal fire.  

Those who pay this price often feel a **hollow space in their [soul](/raw/20250501/soul/soul.md)**, a lingering sense of **something missing**—though **they may never remember what it was.**  

The only mark left behind is a **phantom pain**—a whisper of what was sacrificed.

## **The Unbreakable Laws of the Concordium Medica**  

1. **We heal, but we do not kill.** A Concordium physician may **never take a life**, nor assist those who do so unjustly.  
2. **Gold holds no power over us.** Payment is made in **vows, knowledge, neutrality, or sacrifice**—never in coin.  
3. **A contract once made cannot be broken.** To defy the Concordium’s terms is to **invite ruin upon oneself.**  
4. **We do not choose sides.** No war, no kingdom, no force may sway the Concordium’s neutrality.  
5. **Healing must serve a purpose.** Every wound mended **must contribute to Balance, Wisdom, or Order.**

## **The Role of a Concordium Physician**  

A Tiefling healer of the Concordium Medica is **a walking contract**, a physician whose every act of mercy **alters the fate of the world**. They are seen as **both saviors and enforcers of cosmic law**.  

- They walk among battlefields, their hands **stained with both blood and ink**.  
- They step into the halls of kings, speaking **truths that cannot be denied**.  
- They **watch, record, and balance**, ensuring that no one escapes **the price of their survival.**  

Their sigil is **a golden [scale](/geography/landmark/scale.md) held by a skeletal hand**—a symbol of both **judgment and mercy, healing and consequence.**  

To seek their aid is to **seal a pact with forces beyond mortal understanding**—for in the world of the Concordium Medica, **every wound has a price, and every price must be paid.**
