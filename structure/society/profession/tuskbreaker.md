# Tuskbreakers – The Fossil Crushers  
*"Bones of the past, weapons of the future."*  

![tuskbreaker.webp](/professions/tuskbreaker.webp =500x)

The **Tuskbreakers** are orcish masters of reclaiming power from the dead, inspired by the legendary [Skul’Kruk](/being/titan/skul-kruk.md) – The Fossil Crusher. They unearth the colossal remains of long-extinct behemoths and ancient warriors, carving them into brutal weapons and armor infused with the lingering [resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md) of the magical collapse. Unlike mere blacksmiths or enchanters, Tuskbreakers do not simply shape materials—they force the past to fight for the present, wrenching raw power from fossilized remains through strength, ritual, and brutal craftsmanship.  

## The Legend of Skul’Kruk  

*"Bones of the past, weapons of the future. The earth does not forget, and neither does he."*  

[Skul’Kruk](/being/titan/skul-kruk.md) is the last of his kind, a colossal entity born from the remains of ancient behemoths and infused with the essence of war itself. Crafted in an age long past by orcish shamans and warlords, he was meant to be the ultimate weapon—a walking monument to destruction, carrying the strength of fallen titans in every bone and muscle. But when the wars ended and his creators were lost to time, Skul’Kruk remained, his purpose uncertain, his rage no longer eternal.  

Over the centuries, the fire that once fueled [Skul’Kruk](/being/titan/skul-kruk.md) has waned. Though still a formidable force, the relentless fury that once drove him to endless war has dulled, tempered by time and solitude. No longer the mindless engine of destruction he once was, he now roams not in search of battle, but out of habit, his towering form a fading echo of an age of war long past. Some believe he lingers, waiting for a cause to reignite his fury. Others claim that even war itself may no longer be enough to stir the beast he once was.  

The Tuskbreakers see themselves as his inheritors. While he may have slowed, they carry his purpose forward, ensuring the power of the past is never forgotten.  

## The Ways of the Tuskbreakers  

### Unearthing the Relics  
Tuskbreakers brave the depths of crumbling ruins, bone-ridden battlefields, and fossil-laden caverns. These sites, steeped in history, still hum with the energies of [the collapse](/structure/chronological/event/the-collapse.md). The colossal remains they recover—great tusks, thick vertebrae, and petrified claws—serve as the raw material for their art.  

A Tuskbreaker does not merely dig for fossils. They tear them from the earth. Shovels are for the weak—Tuskbreakers use warhammers, bare fists, and ritual axes to break open the past and expose its lingering might.  

### Cleansing and Carving  
Once recovered, the fossils are purified using enchanted resins, sacred orcish water, and brute force. The Tuskbreaker shapes the remains through intense physical labor—chiseling, hammering, and breaking them into the perfect form.  

Unlike dwarves, who refine and polish, or elves, who delicately weave their [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), orcish Tuskbreakers embrace raw, untamed craftsmanship. They believe that fossils hold power in their natural state, needing only the right amount of force to awaken their full potential.  

### Fossil Infusion & the Ritual of War  
The final step is infusion, where the Tuskbreaker awakens the relic’s true potential.  

#### **Traditional**  
Most Tuskbreakers conduct a totem ritual, marking the ground with blood and battle-ashes while chanting ancient war cries. They do not merely imbue their artifacts with power—they drown them in war and violence, ensuring each relic is born of battle and ready to shatter armor, bone, and spirit alike.  

#### **Fizzlemancy**  
Some modern variants of the craft deviate from traditional methods, turning to a Fizzlemancer and letting them imbue the fossil artifact with [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), resulting in unpredictable, yet often devastating effects.  

## Signature Creations of the Tuskbreakers  

### **The Evershard Maul**  
A warhammer forged from the fossilized skull of a long-dead titan beast. Each strike unleashes a shockwave, cracking the earth beneath its wielder’s foes.  

### **Marrowplate**  
Armor infused with layered fossil shards, making the wearer as unyielding as the behemoths of the past. Blades shatter against its surface like waves against stone.  

### **Fossilfang Blades**  
Serrated twin daggers carved from the teeth of an ancient predator. Their edges vibrate with [resonance](/generated/resonance/resonance.md), allowing them to rip through enchanted defenses with ease.  

### **Tuskbreaker Warstompers**  
Enormous boots reinforced with dense fossil shards. A warrior wearing these can send seismic ripples through the battlefield, toppling enemies with each step.  

### **The Spinebreaker Gauntlet**  
A petrified vertebra reformed into a gauntlet, amplifying the wearer’s strength twofold. A single punch can shatter armor and break siege gates.  

## The Role of a Tuskbreaker  
Tuskbreakers are more than craftsmen—they are warriors, breakers, and shapers of power. To wield the work of a Tuskbreaker is to carry the strength of the ancients, bound and reforged through brute force and orcish will.  

Some walk the traditional path, calling upon the rituals of war to craft weapons steeped in blood and battle. Others embrace [Fizzlemancy](/structure/society/profession/fizzlemancy.md), bending the power of the past through chaotic experimentation, risking explosions, misfires, or unpredictable destruction.  

Either way, their weapons are not just tools of war—they are challenges to the battlefield, roaring echoes of an age before [the collapse](/structure/chronological/event/the-collapse.md). Where others see fossils as dead relics, the Tuskbreakers see weapons waiting to be born.
