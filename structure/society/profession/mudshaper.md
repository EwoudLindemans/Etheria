# Profession: Mudshaper (Ogre Architects of Living Clay)

![mud-shaper.webp](/images/professions/mud-shaper.webp =500x)

## Concept & Fantasy Twist:
Deep in the swampy heartlands where stone is scarce but **earth is alive**, the ogres of Glutt’thar have perfected a profession both sacred and practical—the **Mudshaper**. These towering artisans use their immense strength and deep connection to the land to **mold entire homes, forge living armor, and breathe crude life into lumbering golems** using enchanted mud, clay, and swamp essence. Their work is revered, for they do not simply build—they **grow** their creations, shaping structures that shift over time, armor that repairs itself when fed with fresh earth, and golems that stir to life when given purpose.

To outsiders, their methods seem crude, but to the ogres, **a well-shaped bog wall can withstand a siege**, and a **properly sculpted Mud Golem can defend a village for generations.**

## Race: Ogre
Ogres possess **massive hands perfect for sculpting**, a natural affinity for **earth magic**, and an **innate patience** that allows them to work with slow-hardening clay. Unlike their more brutish cousins, Mudshapers are seen as **wise and deliberate**, taking decades to perfect their craft.

## Game Mechanics & Abilities:
- **Bog-Forged Armor & Weapons:** The Mudshaper can shape armor and weapons from enchanted clay that **hardens on impact but remains flexible in motion**. Mud armor provides **temporary HP when struck** and weapons may slow enemies as thick sludge clings to them.  
- **Golem-Crafter’s Touch (1/long rest):** The Mudshaper can form a **temporary Mud Golem**, a massive construct of clay and peat that follows basic commands. If destroyed, it crumbles into **useful raw materials** instead of vanishing completely.  
- **Living Shelter:** The Mudshaper can sculpt an entire **fortified dwelling** from enchanted mud, capable of self-repairing over time. Some of their **homes can even shift slightly**, adapting to their environment.  
- **Quagmire Surge:** Slamming their hands into the ground, the Mudshaper can briefly **soften the earth beneath enemies**, turning it into thick mud that slows or restrains creatures who fail a Strength save.  

## Daily Tasks & Roleplaying Hooks:
- Mudshapers **chant deep, rhythmic songs** while they work, believing sound helps shape the soul of their creations.  
- Some villages **grow attached to their Mud Golems**, treating them as part of the community—until a greedy warlord arrives, wanting to **enslave the living clay for war.**  
- A rival Mudshaper has been **crafting unstable, aggressive golems**, threatening the safety of the land. The **elders demand their creations be destroyed—but what if the golems have begun to think for themselves?**  
- **A legendary structure, a temple said to move with the swamp itself, has been lost for centuries.** Only a true Mudshaper can sense its living walls and bring it back to the surface.
