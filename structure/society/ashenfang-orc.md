# Ashenfang Orcs

## Origins

The Ashenfang Orcs are a corrupted splinter of the once-proud Bonebreaker lineage. Where the Bonebreakers honored death as an end and a memory, the Ashenfang Orcs saw only potential—a resource to be weaponized. Seduced by the forbidden crafts of the Ashenfang Artisans, they broke from their kin, discarding old traditions in favor of darker ambitions. Now, they walk clad in ash and bone, a mockery of the life they once cherished.

Their rites are drenched in soul-binding, in the forced union of lingering spirits and shattered remains. They believe that true power lies in conquest not only of the living but of the very dead—that life should serve death, and death should serve ambition.

## Visual Identity

Ashenfang Orcs are unsettling to behold:

- Their armor is grafted with jagged bone and etched with sigils that shimmer faintly in dying light.
- Their eyes burn with a sickly, ember-like glow, a visible mark of the soul-forging rituals they endure.
- Their war banners are woven with scraps of burial cloth and painted in crushed bone dust, trailing like ghostly flames.
- Some warriors wear skeletal masks or adorn themselves with ribcage pauldrons, each piece a trophy torn from the ancient dead.

Ash and soot cling to them like a second skin, and wherever they tread, the air grows heavier—a thin whisper of despair hanging in their wake.

## Objective

The Ashenfang Orcs seek nothing less than the total domination of the Skein of Bones and the Mistveil Marshes.

Their grand design is simple and horrific:

- **Harvest the Bones:** They intend to strip the Skein of Bones of its last sacred relics—the towering ribs, the ancestor remains, the fossilized echoes—grinding them into the raw material for their forges of undeath.
- **Bind the Souls:** In the Mistveil Marshes, the souls safeguarded by the Ogres of Glutt'thar are the key. The Ashenfang Orcs raid relentlessly, seeking to capture these wandering spirits and force them into bone frames.
- **Forge the Army:** Bones alone are brittle. Souls alone are fleeting. But together, under the Ashenfang artisans' dark craft, they can forge an unbreakable army: silent, tireless, immortal. An army that will not just conquer the Blooming Skein but spread its dominion far beyond, smothering all new life in a tide of ash and bone.

Their leaders, black-hearted chieftains and spirit-binders, call this vision "The Unbroken Host"—a force that will turn the cycle of life and death into a stagnant, endless dominion of undeath.

## Tactics and Methods

The Ashenfang Orcs do not fight like living armies. Their assaults are relentless, coordinated, and merciless:

- **Bonebound Constructs:** Twisted fusions of skeletal beasts and stolen souls lumber beside their warriors.
- **Soul Nets:** Ethereal snares woven from spirit-thread and black bone, capable of dragging a living soul from its body.
- **Ashen Rituals:** Before battles, warpriests daub ash and blood on their warriors, hardening them against pain and fear.
- **Desecration March:** After conquering an area, they leave it deliberately poisoned—sowing curses into the very soil to prevent anything from regrowing.

## Relations

- **Bonebreakers:** Seen as weak, nostalgic fools clinging to dead honor.
- **Verdant Claws:** Hated with a cold fury—the Blooming Skein’s rampant growth threatens the Ashenfang's dominion over death.
- **Ogres of Glutt'thar:** Obstacles. Once respected as fellow keepers of death, now viewed as hoarders of power meant to be seized.

## Current Conflict

The Blooming Skein's unchecked expansion has begun to choke the Skein of Bones, burying relics beneath living roots. If the Ashenfang Orcs cannot harvest the bones soon, they risk losing their supply of raw materials forever.

At the same time, the Mistveil Marshes' souls grow restless. Raiding parties, carrying cursed bone-lanterns, have already begun skirmishing with the Ogres' soulwardens. Each spirit captured is a small victory; each delay threatens the timetable for raising the Unbroken Host.

The Ashenfang Orcs are on the brink. Triumph would see them unleash an unstoppable plague of bone across the land. Failure would see their embers extinguished forever beneath vines and sun.

And they will not fail quietly.
