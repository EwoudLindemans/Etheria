# The Ragged Goons

![the-ragged-goons.webp](/world/the-ragged-goons.webp =500x)

The **Ragged Goons** are a rogue faction of outcasts, scavengers, and [scale](/location/scale.md)-exploiters who thrive on the chaos of [Etheria](/etheria.md)’s fringes. Born in the wake of a catastrophic scale experiment in **Arc 131**, they reject the sanctity of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)’s relics, viewing the scales as tools to be stripped and wielded. Their history is one of reckless raids, bloody rivalries, and a stubborn refusal to bow to the world’s order—a legacy that endures even as their numbers dwindle in the **Arc of Corruption**.

## Origins: The Spark of Defiance (Arc 131)

The Goons trace their roots to a disaster in **[Triz Valley](/location/settlement/city/triz-valley.md)**, where a botched attempt to harness a **Hidden [Scale](/location/scale.md)** conduit unleashed wild [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), leveling a quarry and displacing dozens. Exiled by the **[Council of Or](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or/council-of-or.md)**, the survivors rallied under **Ruk “Splinter” Varn**, a tinkerer who lost an arm to the blast and forged a prosthetic from scale shards. Declaring the scales theirs to claim, Ruk led his band into the **[Mountains of Triz](/location/landmark/mountains-of-triz.md)**, clashing with **[Gurdalk’s Gang](/location/landmark/mountains-of-triz/gurdalks-gang.md)** and stealing traps to craft their first weapons. This marked the Goons’ ethos: take what works, consequences be damned.

## Creed and Culture

The Ragged Goons live by a creed of chaos over control, survival over tradition. They lack formal structure—leadership falls to the boldest or bloodiest until toppled—and their tools reflect their rough ingenuity.

- **Philosophy**: The scales are resources, not relics. Power belongs to those who seize it.
- **Weapons**: 
  - **Splinterguns**: Ramshackle firearms that shoot jagged [scale](/location/scale.md) shards, prone to misfiring but deadly when they hit.
  - **Rattlepacks**: Explosive satchels charged with corrupted [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), as dangerous to the user as the target.
- **Mark of the Goon**: Members scar themselves with [scale](/location/scale.md) dust, creating glowing, jagged tattoos that flare near a scale’s [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md)—an alert system and badge of loyalty.

## Key Tales

### The Raid on Mohinders (Arc 135)

In **Arc 135**, the Goons targeted **[Mohinders](/location/settlement/city/mohinders.md)**, the suspended city atop **[Eldeviérs Shell](/location/scale/eldeviérs-shell.md)**, seeking its stockpile of [scale](/location/scale.md) essence. Led by Ruk Splinter, they scaled the spire with stolen grappling hooks, braving jungle depths and [Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) guards. They siphoned essence into crude canisters, but a Rattlepack surge cracked the Shell, crashing part of the city and killing half the raiders—including **Tessa “Blastjaw” Korr**. The survivors escaped with enough essence to arm themselves for years, cementing their infamy.

### The Clash with the Scalebreakers (Arc 149)

The Goons’ rivalry with the **Scalebreakers** erupted at **Batès Lamina**, where both sought the sacred red [scale](/location/scale.md)’s power. The Goons aimed to build a massive Splintergun cannon; the Scalebreakers, led by **Veyra Tidescale**, sought to shatter it. In a lake battle, Ruk’s Rattlepacks met Veyra’s geysers, ending in a stalemate when the **Followers of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)** drove both off with resonant chants. The Goons retreated with scraps, nursing a grudge against their foes.

### The Chorus Gambit (Arc 151)

As the **Shattered Chorus** wailed in **Arc 137**, the Goons exploited the chaos, raiding weakened settlements. In **Arc 151**, Ruk targeted **The [City of Or](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or.md)**, planting a stolen **[Resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) Anchor** from the **Veiled Canticle** to amplify the Chorus and disrupt the dwarves’ forges. The plan backfired—the surge awoke a monstrous [Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) that crushed Ruk and scattered his band, ending his reign.

## The Goons Today (Arc 152)

Ruk’s death fractured the Goons, but their spirit persists in scattered crews. **Kez “Rattleskin” Dray**, a goblin deserter from [Gurdalk’s Gang](/location/landmark/mountains-of-triz/gurdalks-gang.md), leads a brutal remnant near [Triz Valley](/location/settlement/city/triz-valley.md), rigging Chorus-charged traps. Their raids have scarred **[Mohinders](/location/settlement/city/mohinders.md)**, cracked **Batès Lamina**, and rattled **The [City of Or](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or.md)**, while the **Merchants Guild** quietly trades for their loot. Rumors swirl of Ruk’s glowing tattoos hinting at an [Iridian](/being/species/iridian.md) rebirth, or a hidden essence cache in the **[Mountains of Triz](/location/landmark/mountains-of-triz.md)**.

## Legacy and Impact

The Ragged Goons are [Etheria](/etheria.md)’s untamed edge—a foil to the reverence of the **Followers of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md)**, the zeal of the **Scalebreakers**, and the order of the **Veiled Canticle**. Neither heroes nor villains, they’re survivors scrapping by in a world of corrupted scales and fading [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md). Their tales of grit and ruin echo across Etheria, a testament to the cost of defying its [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md).
