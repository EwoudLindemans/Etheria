## Overview
The Rusty Pluckers are the **in-house band of [The Brazen Burp](/location/settlement/city/or/the-brazen-burp)**, a renowned establishment in **The [City of Or](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or)**. Once adventurers, they traded weapons for instruments and found their true calling in music. Their performances are a mix of raw talent, unpredictable antics, and deep-rooted camaraderie. Though they perform solo, they are also known as the **unofficial backing band for [Miss Terry](/being/character/miss-terry)**, the jolly Tiefling bard. Their collaboration has led to the band promoting itself as **"Miss Terry and The Rusty Pluckers"**, an unexpected fusion that attracts crowds from opposite ends of the musical spectrum.

Bogrum the Booming shares an especially close friendship with the tavern keep, a man of few words but keen observation. Their bond runs deep, forged over years of shared tales, brawls, and an endless supply of ale. The Rusty Pluckers are as much a part of the tavern’s foundation as its worn wooden beams, their music echoing through its halls night after night.

## Band Members

### **Bogrum the Booming** *(Percussion, Composer, Business Mind)*
Bogrum, a half-orc percussionist, has a natural talent for hitting anything that makes a sound—**bones, barrels, tambourines, glockenspiels**, and, most importantly, his **beloved triangle**. Despite his carefree demeanor, he possesses a **sharp business mind**, ensuring that the band remains financially afloat. He is the **inventor of the infamous Brazen Brew**, a concoction both feared and revered by the bravest drinkers. His composition *The Battle of [the Brazen Burp](/location/settlement/city/or/the-brazen-burp)* immortalized a legendary tavern brawl, forever tying the band’s identity to the chaos and merriment of The Brazen Tavern.

### **Mugrum the Muted** *(Bass, Horns, Pipes, Background Vocals, Poet)*
The towering, silent force behind the band, Mugrum, is known for his **deep, resonant background grunts**, a sound so rhythmic it borders on a secret language. He rarely speaks, instead murmuring cryptic phrases that his younger brother Bogrum translates. Dressed in an **elegant but perpetually dusty suit**, he exudes an air of quiet mystery. He is a **secret poet**, likely publishing under a pseudonym, and a skilled musician who plays **bass instruments, horns, and pipes**. Mugrum is also learning to play the violin, instructed by Sparky.

### **Sparky (Grak’tul Vriz Zik’kak)** *(Strings, Inventor, Tinkerer)*
Grak’tul Vriz Zik’kak, whose name translates to **"Past the Shadow, a Spark,"** is a goblin with a **comically long gray beard** that many assume is fake (it is not). His name is **infamously difficult to pronounce**, and most people cannot remember its full translation. He is highly particular about being addressed properly, yet, ironically, has **embraced the name "Sparky"**—not because it relates to his real name, but because of his **lightning-[magic](/structure/mechanic/magic) experiments** on musical instruments. Over time, he has come to **wear the name with pride**, reclaiming it as an identity of his own choosing.

Sparky is an **eccentric inventor**, constantly modifying instruments with experimental [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic). He was the **first to create lightning-powered lutes** and **synthetic key harmonicas**, though he is just as happy playing **the off-key piano in [The Brazen Burp](/location/settlement/city/or/the-brazen-burp)**. His musical innovations have shaped his legacy, though his most recent prototype tends to either inspire awe or set something on fire.

### **Miss Terry** *(Honorary Guest Singer, Bard Extraordinaire)*
[Miss Terry](/being/character/miss-terry), the **jolly Tiefling bard**, is an honorary guest singer with The Rusty Pluckers. Though their roles shift between her joining them as a featured act or them backing her performance, their chemistry on stage is undeniable. She is a masterful performer whose soulful voice and theatrical flair **contrast beautifully with The Rusty Pluckers' raw, chaotic energy**. Together, they form an **unlikely but captivating fusion**, drawing music lovers of all backgrounds.

## Band History
The Rusty Pluckers began as a **cover band** performing at **Ogre food festivals**, filling their time between gigs as amateur **[Tankard Trekkers](/profession/tankard-trekkers)**. Their search for the world’s greatest taverns ended when they stumbled upon **The Brazen Tavern**, a place they have **never left since**. Over time, they evolved into more than just a band; they became an integral part of the tavern’s [legend](/being/deity/legend). Their performances are filled with **boisterous laughter, heartfelt ballads, and the occasional magical mishap**.

Bogrum and Sparky first met during their time in the **military**, fighting side by side in a battle neither was truly fit for. Sparky, already known for his experimental ways, was a tinkerer even then, looking for any excuse to take apart weapons and turn them into something that made a sound. Bogrum, on the other hand, had developed a keen sense of rhythm and a powerful drumming style that demanded attention. It didn’t take long for them to become fast friends. When they both deserted the army—Bogrum tired of the violence and Sparky too sensitive for the harsh environment—they decided to pursue their true passions: music.

The two ex-soldiers started off performing at **Ogre food festivals**, a unique gig where they found their footing as an impromptu **cover band**. As they traveled from one festival to the next, they became amateur **[Tankard Trekkers](/profession/tankard-trekkers)**, testing out new drinks and seeking out the best taverns to play in. Their journey ultimately led them to The Brazen Tavern, a place they fell in love with almost immediately. The tavern’s ambiance, patrons, and the tavern keep’s loyalty to their music were enough to keep them in one place. They have stayed ever since, honing their skills and earning a reputation that has only grown with the years.

## Reputation
The Rusty Pluckers are a **beloved act** among adventurers, tavern-goers, and musical oddballs alike. Their performances range from **beautifully executed melodies** to **chaotic, drunken disasters**, yet somehow, their charm remains intact. Their collaboration with [Miss Terry](/being/character/miss-terry) has elevated them to new heights, bringing together a community of misfits and music lovers. Insulting The Rusty Pluckers in The Brazen Tavern is **a guaranteed way to start a fight**, though the band themselves prefer to let their music speak for them.
