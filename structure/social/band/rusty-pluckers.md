# The Rusty Pluckers

## Overview
The Rusty Pluckers are a ragtag band of retired adventurers-turned-musicians, known for their wildly enthusiastic performances and deep-seated love for tavern music. Though their pay is meager, their passion is boundless, and they have made their home at one of the finest taverns in **The City of Or**. The band provides background music, accompanies performances, and occasionally steals the spotlight with their own legendary songs.

## Band Members

### **Bogrum the Booming**
- **Role:** Percussionist, Business Manager, Songwriter
- **Instruments:** Any percussion and related instruments, including **glockenspiel, bones and barrels, tambourine, and his favorite—the triangle.**
- **Background:** A former war drummer, Bogrum’s rhythmic skills were once used to lead battalions into battle. After meeting Sparky (then known as Grak’tul Vriz Zik’kak) in the army, he decided that music was his true calling. Together, they left the military and began their journey as musicians.
- **Legacy:** Bogrum is the creator of the **Brazen Brew**, a fiery concoction of whiskey, cider, gin, stout beer, and (animal) blood. His chaotic past also led him to write **“The Battle of The Brazen Burp”**, a ballad about an infamous tavern brawl that ended in unexpected friendship and the invention of the drink itself.
- **Personality:** A charismatic and loud half-orc with a keen business sense, he ensures that the Rusty Pluckers remain well-fed and comfortably settled in their tavern home.

### **Mugrum the Muted**
- **Role:** Bassist, Background Grunter, Poet
- **Instruments:** Any bass instruments, pipes, horns
- **Background:** Larger than most half-orcs, Mugrum served in the military alongside his brother but struggled with the horrors of war. A deeply sensitive soul, he found solace in music and poetry, secretly writing under a pseudonym. Despite being misunderstood as slow-witted, he is highly intelligent and has even developed his own language of deep, resonant grunts.
- **Personality:** Quiet, introverted, and always impeccably dressed in a dusty formal suit with a bowtie. He rarely makes eye contact and speaks mostly in murmurs, relying on Bogrum to translate for him. Despite his reserved nature, his musical talent is undeniable, and his contributions to the band's sound are invaluable.

### **Grak’tul Vriz Zik’kak (a.k.a. Sparky)**
- **Role:** Instrumentalist, Tinkerer, Musical Innovator
- **Instruments:** Various experimental gnomish and goblin-crafted musical devices, traditional lutes, and honky-tonk piano
- **Background:** A goblin with a comically long gray beard, Sparky is known for his endless pursuit of musical invention. His past in the army alongside Bogrum led him to abandon warfare in favor of crafting instruments nobody asked for—but everyone receives for free. He was the first performer to experiment with **lightning-powered lutes and synthetic key harmonicas.**
- **Nickname:** Despite insisting on being called by his full name, he has resigned (for artistic reasons) to being called *Sparky*—a name inspired by his habit of electrifying instruments rather than his actual name.
- **Personality:** Chaotic but brilliant, he constantly tinkers with new sounds and techniques, much to the exasperation of tavern patrons who never know what strange noise might come from his latest creation.

## The Band’s History
The Rusty Pluckers started as an accidental venture. Bogrum and Sparky met in the army, where their combined musical talents turned their unit into a force both feared and bewildered by their opponents. However, war was not for them, especially for Mugrum, who found it too emotionally taxing. Together, they left military life behind and took up music full-time.

Their first gigs were at **Ogre food festivals**, performing covers of traditional drinking songs with such enthusiasm that they became regular entertainment at such events. Between festivals, they took up the path of **Tankard Trekkers**—adventurers who travel the world in search of legendary drinks and pubs. Their travels eventually led them to **The City of Or**, where they stumbled upon their true home: the finest tavern they had ever played in.

They never left.

## The Band’s Influence
Despite their low wages, The Rusty Pluckers are beloved by tavern-goers, adventurers, and traveling performers alike. Their music provides a welcoming atmosphere, and their songs—often full of humor and wild storytelling—have taken on lives of their own.

Their influence extends beyond music; **the Brazen Brew**, invented by Bogrum, became a top choice among **Tankard Trekkers**, solidifying their place in the legendary drinking culture of the land.

## Legacy
The Rusty Pluckers are more than just a tavern band. They are a living, breathing part of the culture of **The City of Or**. Whether through Sparky’s bizarre inventions, Mugrum’s poetic grunts, or Bogrum’s booming enthusiasm, they have left a permanent mark on those who enter their tavern’s doors.
