# Skul’Kruk – The Fossil Crusher
“Bones of the past, weapons of the future.”

The Skul’Kruk, or Fossil Crushers, are orcish masters of reclaiming power from the dead. They unearth the colossal remains of long-extinct behemoths and ancient warriors, carving them into brutal weapons and armor infused with the lingering resonance of the magical collapse. Unlike mere blacksmiths or enchanters, Fossil Crushers do not simply shape materials—they force the past to fight for the present, wrenching raw power from fossilized remains through strength, ritual, and brutal craftsmanship.

## The Ways of the Skul’Kruk
1. Unearthing the Relics
Fossil Crushers brave the depths of crumbling ruins, bone-ridden battlefields, and fossil-laden caverns. These sites, steeped in history, still hum with the energies of the collapse. The colossal remains they recover—great tusks, thick vertebrae, and petrified claws—serve as the raw material for their art.

A Fossil Crusher does not merely dig for fossils. They tear them from the earth. Shovels are for the weak—Skul’Kruk use warhammers, bare fists, and ritual axes to break open the past and expose its lingering might.

2. Cleansing and Carving
Once recovered, the fossils are purified using enchanted resins, sacred orcish water, and brute force. The Fossil Crusher shapes the remains through intense physical labor—chiseling, hammering, and breaking them into the perfect form.

Unlike dwarves, who refine and polish, or elves, who delicately weave their magic, orcish Fossil Crushers embrace raw, untamed craftsmanship. They believe that fossils hold power in their natural state, needing only the right amount of force to awaken their full potential.

3. Fossil Infusion & the Ritual of War
The final step is infusion, where the Fossil Crusher awakens the relic’s true potential.

    - Traditional
    Most Fossil Crushers conduct a totem ritual, marking the ground with blood and battle-ashes while chanting ancient war cries. They do not merely imbue their artifacts with power—they drown them in war and violence, ensuring each relic is born of battle and ready to shatter armor, bone, and spirit alike.
    - Fizzlemancy
    Some modern variants of the craft deviate from traditional methods, turning to a Fizzlemancer and let them imbue the fossil artifact with magic, resulting in unpredictable, yet often devastating effects.

## Signature Creations of the Skul’Kruk
1. The Evershard Maul
A warhammer forged from the fossilized skull of a long-dead titan beast. Each strike unleashes a shockwave, cracking the earth beneath its wielder’s foes.
2. Marrowplate
Armor infused with layered fossil shards, making the wearer as unyielding as the behemoths of the past. Blades shatter against its surface like waves against stone.
3. Fossilfang Blades
Serrated twin daggers carved from the teeth of an ancient predator. Their edges vibrate with resonance, allowing them to rip through enchanted defenses with ease.
4. Skul'Kruk Warstompers
Enormous boots reinforced with dense fossil shards. A warrior wearing these can send seismic ripples through the battlefield, toppling enemies with each step.
5. The Spinebreaker Gauntlet
A petrified vertebra reformed into a gauntlet, amplifying the wearer’s strength twofold. A single punch can shatter armor and break siege gates.

## The Role of a Skul’Kruk
Fossil Crushers are more than craftsmen—they are warriors, breakers, and shapers of power. To wield the work of a Skul’Kruk is to carry the strength of the ancients, bound and reforged through brute force and orcish will.

Some walk the traditional path, calling upon the rituals of war to craft weapons steeped in blood and battle. Others embrace Fizzlemancy, bending the power of the past through chaotic experimentation, risking explosions, misfires, or unpredictable destruction.

Either way, their weapons are not just tools of war—they are challenges to the battlefield, roaring echoes of an age before the collapse. Where others see fossils as dead relics, the Skul’Kruk see weapons waiting to be born.
