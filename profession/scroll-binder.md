# Scroll Binder
In a world where diplomacy is as volatile as the shifting winds, the Scroll Binder stands as a crucial mediator, balancing [the scales](/location/landmark/scale/the-scales.md) of power with both precision and skill. A Scroll Binder is not just a scribe or a wizard, but a master of magical agreements and negotiation rituals. Whether dealing with monarchs, merchants, or wandering adventurers, they have the unique ability to bind the terms of any agreement with [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and certainty—ensuring that deals are fair, precise, and lasting.

Drawing their power from three sacred elements—Rock, Paper, and Scissors—Scroll Binders use these seemingly simple tools to resolve even the most complicated of diplomatic disputes. Each throw carries weight and meaning, and the stakes are always high. From determining territorial boundaries to forging alliances, the Scroll Binder’s touch turns words into lasting, magical obligations, enforced by ancient rituals and unbreakable pacts.

In every negotiation, the Scroll Binder is both a neutral party and an active force, wielding their influence to make sure the terms are not just agreed upon, but also honored. Their [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) ensures that no party can back out without facing consequences, and each deal is crafted with both fairness and finality.

The Scroll Binder is known for their ability to mediate and ensure that agreements are honored. They bring clarity and structure to every negotiation, creating agreements that stand the test of time.

Whether you’re seeking to settle a dispute, forge an alliance, or carve out your place in the world, a Scroll Binder is the one to trust with your most important agreements. They bring both clarity and [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) to the table, ensuring that every contract is both fair and final, making them indispensable in any diplomatic scenario.

## The Creation of the Scrolls: The Three Sacred Elements

Before any [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) can be infused or any negotiations can take place, the **Scroll Binder** must **create the scroll itself**. This process is always the same, ensuring that the **scroll is always ready** to carry the weight of whatever **diplomatic** task is required.

- **Rock (Ink)**:  
The **Rock** is crushed into magical ink, the foundation of any scroll. It contains power, capable of recording **strength**, **territory**, or **conquest**—whatever the negotiation requires. This ink binds the spirit of the agreement to the paper.
  
- **Paper (To Write On)**:  
The **Paper** is the medium for the terms, whether it’s trade agreements, alliances, or declarations. It holds the ink’s [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and is fine-tuned to record details in **clear, permanent strokes**, ensuring nothing is left to chance.

- **Scissors (To Cut the Paper)**:  
The **Scissors** ensure that every detail is **measured precisely**. The scroll will not be valid unless the terms are clearly defined—no vague agreements, only **sharp** and **measured clauses**. The scroll is carefully cut so there is no room for additions (except on the back) that is soley reserved for the scroll binder. The (closed) scissors will later be used as a pen to write.

## The Diplomatic Treaty: Resolving Disagreements with Rock, Paper, Scissors

The **Scroll Binder’s** [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) truly shines during the **final resolution** of any diplomatic agreement. Whether it’s dividing a kingdom, setting up a trade agreement, or forming alliances, the **Scroll Binder** uses **Rock, Paper, Scissors** to **determine** the terms. However, they are not just passive spectators—they can adjust the outcome to ensure the agreement remains **fair** and **equitable** for all parties.

Here’s how the **three options** from the game are applied to almost any diplomatic scenario, along with options for the **Scroll Binder** to influence the results:

---

### **Winner with Rock (Building Victory)**

**What Happens**: When **Rock** wins, the scroll doesn’t just give the winner the prize; it requires them to **physically manifest** the victory by **building something**. This might be a **fortress**, a **bridge**, or any **permanent landmark** that solidifies the win. It’s not enough to simply claim the spoils; they must **construct** something that demonstrates their **strength** or **resolve**.

**Examples of Diplomatic Scenarios**:

- **Territorial Claim**: The winner claims the **land**, but they must build a **fortress** or **defensive wall** to secure it.  
  _“Lord Ironfist rocked the deal; he claims the northern pass, but if he doesn’t raise a **fortress** by next winter, it’s forfeit.”_

- **Trade Agreement**: The winner secures the **trade route**, but must **build infrastructure** to prove they’ll follow through.  
  _“Lady Greymist rocked it; she secures the river trade, but must raise a **bridge** across by spring, or the deal’s off.”_

**Scroll Effect**:  
The **scales** thud, locking in a **concrete obligation**. The agreement will be tied to a **building**, **structure**, or **military presence** that must be created to seal the deal. 

**Scroll Binder Influence**:  
The **Scroll Binder** can **adjust the scope** of the “building task” based on the **context**. For instance, they might allow the winner to choose between different types of structures (military, economic, cultural) to suit the circumstances of the negotiation.

---

### **Winner with Paper (Binding Pact)**

**What Happens**: When **Paper** wins, the scroll doesn’t just record the winner’s claim—it **binds** both sides into a **tighter, longer-lasting agreement**. This could mean both sides are **bound by oaths**, **duties**, or **mutual obligations** that they can’t easily escape from. A **binding pact** is created, and the winner gains the prize but with strings attached.

**Examples of Diplomatic Scenarios**:

- **Trade Route**: The winner secures the **route**, but both sides are **bound** to each other with **perpetual trade** or **shared resources**.  
  _“Lady Smirkface papered them; she secures the **trade route**, but both must exchange **grain** and **luxury goods** for the next century.”_

- **Alliance**: The winner gains military support, but the agreement also **locks both sides into future commitments**, like mutual defense, taxes, or even **shared resources**.  
  _“Duke Greymane papered the alliance; he gets the **troops**, but both must **defend** each other’s borders—forever.”_

**Scroll Effect**:  
The **scales** quiver, and the terms are now **tied**. The scroll **locks the parties together**, making it **impossible** to back out without serious consequences.

**Scroll Binder Influence**:  
The **Scroll Binder** can adjust the **depth** of the binding pact, allowing some **flexibility** in the obligations. They might allow both sides to negotiate the terms of their **oaths** or set up **escape clauses** if unforeseen circumstances arise.

---

### **Winner with Scissors (Cutting Divide)**

**What Happens**: When **Scissors** wins, the agreement is **sharp and precise**. There’s no room for vagueness or **dispute**—the terms are **clearly split**. Whether it’s dividing land, resources, or **governing power**, the scroll ensures that the prize is **measured and cut perfectly**, leaving no ambiguity.

**Examples of Diplomatic Scenarios**:

- **Land Division**: The prize—whether it’s **land** or **territory**—is split **equally**.  
  _“Duke Snippy scissored the deal; the **valley’s halved**—**12 miles each**, no exceptions.”_

- **Shared Resources**: The prize is **divided** down to the smallest detail—everything is **precisely measured** and there’s no wiggle room for confusion.  
  _“Lord Firestorm scissored the **mines**—he gets **half the jewels**, but every gem will be weighed and counted.”_

**Scroll Effect**:  
The **scales** snap, and the agreement is now **precisely** defined, leaving no room for dispute. It’s a **clear-cut** division that must be honored.

**Scroll Binder Influence**:  
The **Scroll Binder** has the ability to allow for some **wiggle room** in the division if it feels **unfair** to one side, or perhaps **reorder the items** being divided based on importance to the parties. The **precise** nature of the division can be made **flexible** in some cases.

---

### **The Tiebreaker: The Ultimate Diplomatic Clause**

In the event of a **tie**, the scroll does not leave the situation unresolved. The **Scroll Binder** must act to resolve the conflict.

**What Happens**: The **Scroll Binder** calls for a **rematch** or creates a **magical clause** to escalate the agreement. This might mean sending both parties on a **quest**, or the losing side might have to give up something **valuable** to tip [the scales](/location/landmark/scale/the-scales.md) in favor of the other. Ties are never simple!

**Example**:  
_“If the game ends in a tie, the scroll **binds both sides** to find the **Lost Chalice** in the **Cursed Mountain**—a quest neither can avoid, and the stakes are high.”_

**Scroll Effect**:  
The **scales** tremble, and the scroll **adds a clause**, creating new **obligations** that neither party can easily ignore. It escalates the situation, making the next step even **more important** than the last.

**Scroll Binder Influence**:  
The **Scroll Binder** can **alter** the stakes of the tiebreaker. Perhaps instead of a physical quest, the tie results in **personal sacrifices** or an **addition of another party** to the agreement. The **Binder** can create a path that makes it **fairer**, ensuring that the parties leave the agreement feeling like **both sides had a chance**.
