# Emberglass Shapers – The Keepers of Fire and Memory

![embarglass-shaper_(1).webp](/world/embarglass-shaper_(1).webp =500x)


*"Glass is more than sand and heat. It is light given form, fire made eternal, and memory trapped in crystal."*

The **Emberglass Shapers** are Dragonborn artisans who wield fire and magic to shape glass into objects of beauty, power, and remembrance. Their craft is more than simple glassblowing—it is an ancient art passed down through generations, a sacred duty to preserve history and illuminate the future. Their mirrors reflect more than just faces, their jewels pulse with captured energy, and their memory-glass holds echoes of lost voices.

A true Emberglass Shaper does not just create; they bind fire, shape light, and forge stories into glass.

## The Legend of Izzar’Vharr, the First Shaper

*"Fire is destruction. Fire is creation. I shall teach you both."*

Long ago, when Dragonborn still lived under the rule of elder dragons, there was one who refused to let knowledge fade—**Izzar’Vharr, the First Shaper**. He was no warrior, no sorcerer, but a maker, a guardian of stories. As his people waged war and cities crumbled, he sought a way to preserve history beyond books and stone.

He discovered that with dragonfire and the right minerals, he could create something unbreakable: **Emberglass**, a rare, enchanted glass that could store images, words, even memories. He fashioned the first **Moonlit Mirror**, which showed the truth of things—revealing hidden thoughts, secret fears, and even glimpses of fate. He crafted the **Soulglass Orbs**, which held the voices of lost elders so they might never be forgotten.

Izzar’Vharr's creations spread across the land, coveted by kings, scholars, and warlords alike. But his greatest masterpiece, the **Eternal Prism**, a perfect crystal said to hold the wisdom of a thousand lifetimes, was lost to time. Some say it shattered, its pieces hidden in the works of Emberglass Shapers to this day. Others believe it still waits to be found, glowing in the darkest corners of the world.

The **Emberglass Shapers** see themselves as his successors, continuing his work so that no knowledge, no beauty, and no soul is ever truly lost.

## The Ways of the Emberglass Shapers

### Forging the Flameglass
Creating Emberglass is no simple task. It begins with the gathering of **rare sands**—some from volcanic shores, others from the depths of the desert, and the rarest, from the bones of fallen dragons. These materials are melted with **dragonfire breath**, infused with magic, and shaped through both precision and instinct.

The result is not ordinary glass, but something **alive**—glass that holds light within it, that shimmers like dragon scales, that remembers the touch of those who wield it.

## The Signature Creations of the Emberglass Shapers

### **Moonlit Mirrors**  
*"A mirror that does not lie."*  
Crafted from the purest Emberglass, these mirrors reveal more than just reflections. They can show hidden truths, uncover illusions, and even capture fleeting visions of the past or future. Some rulers and nobles refuse to stand before one, fearing what may be revealed.

### **Soulglass Orbs**  
*"Voices of the past, never silenced."*  
Each orb is imbued with the essence of a person’s memory, preserving their words, emotions, or even a fragment of their soul. Used by scholars, oracles, and grieving families, they ensure that knowledge and love do not fade with time.

### **Dragon’s Eye Jewels**  
*"A jewel that sees."*  
These flawless gemstones hold a sliver of flame within them. Some act as magical focuses, enhancing a wearer’s spells. Others are said to allow glimpses of unseen things—hidden doors, disguised foes, or even spirits wandering the veil between life and death.

### **Runewrought Lenses**  
*"The world seen through fire."*  
These finely cut glass lenses are inscribed with draconic runes, granting the wearer enhanced vision, the ability to see magic, or even to read lost scripts. Some thieves and spies seek these lenses for more illicit purposes.

### **The Everflame Lantern**  
*"A light that never dies."*  
A relic of old, these lanterns burn with a glass-encased fire that never extinguishes, even underwater or in magical darkness. They serve as guiding beacons, carried by travelers, warriors, and those who guard sacred places.

### **The Fractured Prism**  
*"Each shard holds a different truth."*  
An experimental work, these strange, multi-faceted crystals warp perception, revealing hidden layers of reality. A warrior might see an enemy’s next strike before it lands. A sage might glimpse a hidden riddle within a text. But such power is unpredictable, and some shards show things best left unseen.

## The Role of an Emberglass Shaper
**Emberglass Shapers** are more than artisans; they are **historians, visionaries, and guardians of memory**. Their work is found in temples, royal halls, arcane towers, and ancient tombs.

Some work openly, selling their wares to nobles and adventurers. Others operate in secrecy, creating mirrors that expose hidden crimes or crafting soulglass to preserve dying last words. A few seek out the lost works of **Izzar’Vharr**, hunting for fragments of the **Eternal Prism** in the hope of unlocking its forgotten wisdom.

To the Dragonborn, an **Emberglass Shaper** is a keeper of light, ensuring that fire, knowledge, and legacy are never truly extinguished.
