# Etheria
In the old days past, a world collided with the magical creature [Irion](/i/40). Rupturing the planet and breaking it down into a thousand. But with time the planet healed through the magical residue that the creature left behind. This event that created the world is now known as [The Collapse](/i/17) The origin of the ancient creature is unknown, but there are many theories. Some say that it is a dragon that was petrified by a powerful magic. Thus causing a collision Others say that it is a giant creature that was created by the gods. Whatever the truth may be, the ancient creature remains a mystery.

The magical essence of the creature is what gives Etheria its unique properties. It is a world that is alive and constantly changing. The land itself is alive and has a will of its own. The rivers flow with magical energy, and the trees grow to impossible heights. Even the air itself is thick with magic. It is a world that is in constant flux, and it is this magic that makes it so special.
It is said that in certain area's the magical essence has merged so much that Mountains shift, valleys rise and fall, and forests expand and contract as if the land itself were breathing.

In the aftermath of The Collapse, the survival of the people on Etheria hinged on their ability to adapt to the presence of magical scales left behind by the collision with the creature Irion. These colossal, shimmering scales, with immense height and width, became not only a symbol of the cataclysmic event but also a lifeline for the scattered survivors.

- Scale Sanctuaries:
Communities quickly discovered that areas where these magical scales were concentrated had unique properties. The scales emitted a soothing energy that repelled the more dangerous creatures that roamed the post-collapse landscape. People began to build settlements around these scale sanctuaries, utilizing the immense size of the scales as natural barriers and shelters against the monstrous threats.

- Scale-Backed Infrastructure:
The immense size of the magical scales allowed survivors to build intricate shelters and structures by incorporating the scales into their architecture. Scales served as roofs, walls, and even bridges between settlements. This integration not only provided robust protection but also fostered a sense of connection with the magical essence that had reshaped their world.

- Scale Conduits:
Over time, the survivors learned to harness the latent magic within the scales to power various devices and technologies. Scales could be infused into tools, lighting systems, and communication devices, creating a kind of "scale-driven" technological renaissance that facilitated their resurgence as a civilization.

There is no one ruler of Etheria. Each race has its own territory that it controls. But there is an overall peace throughout Etheria that is maintained by the Council of Elders. This is a group of wise beings who represent each race and act as mediators between them. They settle disputes and keep the peace throughout Etheria

## [Magic](#)
From every place in the land remaining scales of the ancient creature could be seen reaching unbelievable heights. The scales containing immense magic are almost impossible to penetrate and thus are left alone by most of the inhabitants of Etheria. But there are few that managed to pierce small gaps into the thick plates, more often than not paying it with their lives. From those gaps sparks of magic can be seen hitting the land that surrounds it. With special means cities managed to stabalize the sparks using it as a power source. Nowadays its stricly forbidden attempting to create new cavities.

The largest such cavity is located in the old ruins of an ancient kingdom, now called Kin'Darei. The ruined city is surrounded by a great moat filled with deadly creatures that are attracted to this magical place. Even if one manages to pass through all travellers are constantly hunted down and killed before they can reach the ruin's walls. Not even giants dare to enter because of what lies inside, there have been no survivors who had escaped from it telling tales about its wonders.

Some people have managed to find ways to harness the magic inside the scales. In order to do so, they need to use special tools called scalespeakers. A scalespeaker is a device that contains a crystal that resonates with the magic inside the scales. When the scalespeaker is placed over the scale, the magic inside the scale will resonate with the crystal and cause it to emit a strong beam of magic. The magic that is emitted from the scale can be used for many purposes, such as powering magical devices, or even used as a weapon. However, using the magic in this way is very dangerous and often results in death or serious injury.

## The Five Scales
Up until now there are Five [Scales](/i/19) that penetrate the surface. But it is believed that there could be many more hidden deeply underground. A dangerous group called [The Ragged Goons](#) made it their sole purpose to find and exploit new (unprotected) scales.

### [The Armour of Or](/i/12) (slightly red with white, largest, lowest)
While it is the largest scale with a crossection of about 30.000 feet, it is also the lowest. It got excavated underneath the mountain by the Flatstone family. The lands surrounding it are mostly tundra with a bit of fertile land here and there. The color is white. with a few spikes that are faintly red/orange.
  In addition to being the largest scale, the Armour of Or has unique crystalline formations that grow on its surface, which are highly prized by alchemists for their magical properties. The [City of Or](/settlement/city/or/city-of-or), built by dwarves beneath the scale, is known for its impressive forges and metallurgy.
### [Batès Lamina](/i/39)
The smallest of all scales, Its a bright red colored scale. it became a precious place to the Followers of Irion. Its sits in the middle of a lake with a city build around it, in open fields this city has barely enough defenses to protect itself. Batès Lamina has a highly unusual property in that it emits a low-frequency hum that can be felt throughout the city built around it. The hum is said to have a calming effect on the inhabitants and is even used as a form of meditation by the Followers of Irion.
### [Eldeviérs Shell](#)
The Shell is colored in a bright opal green. On this scale that mostly represents a tall looking spire the city Mohinders is build hanging suspeded in the air.  It is attached with several large iron rings that were build around the spire to give the city stability and attached at the top with iron chains. The city hangs at a height of 2000 feet and can only be reached trough magical manners. The peak of the shell has device that collects energy from the scale powering several portals to the ground. The opal green color of the Eldeviérs Shell is not just for show - the scale actually emits a soft green light that illuminates the city of Mohinders suspended above it. The light is also said to have healing properties, making Mohinders a popular destination for those seeking to heal from ailments.
### [Umperas Hull](#) (yellow)
A large curved scale with the top broken off, it pretty much resembles a long running wall, that curves away making for a great city surrounded by the hull, its color is a beatifull yellow with slight hints of orange.
### [The Asara Plate](#)
The Asara Plate sits at a 30° angle and is broken in half, with a route running underneath the overhang and a side road between the two halves. This unique scale is a sight to behold, with its stunning blue color caused by the reflective crystal formations that cover its surface. The reflection of the sun's rays creates a dazzling light show that can be seen for miles around, which has become a major attraction for the merchants and travelers who use the roads below. Many of them time their journeys to pass beneath the plate during sunset to witness the spectacle, adding to the allure of the scale.

### [The Orinite Ring](/i/41)
A black circle with a red inner lining. It is the only scale that doesn't have any land on it and orbits around the world. It has a magical field that protects those inside from the vacuum of space.

## Religions
- **Followers of Irion**, a religious organisation that communes with the remaining spirit of the magical creature Irion that still resides in the magical scales. They use Batès Lamina as shrine's and will protect it whatever the cost.
- **Redemptious Myphos**, or more commonly known as **The Arcane Fangs** is a group of culprits that focusus on finding and exploiting magical scales. Usually for their own benefit of becoming rich or powerful. They believe that the scale's should be for everyone to use to make life easier. Some of them have obtained immense powers through different means of refining scales, and fusing them into specialized gear or even themselves.
- The **Cult of Dy** theorizes that every action and reaction by living beings is randomly determined by the three deities called Dy, who roll their magic stones to determine the outcome. Even though evidence for this is slim, the Cult of Dy has many dangerous rituals where they challenge their faith by subjecting condemned criminals and lesser animals to The Fire Trials. If luck is on their side, they are set free unconditionally.
