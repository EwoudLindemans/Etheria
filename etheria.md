# Etheria
In the old days past, a world collided with the magical creature Irion. Rupturing the planet and breaking it down into a million pieces. But with time the planet healed through the magical residue that the creature left behind. This event that created the world is now known as [The Collapse](/the-collapse) The origin of the ancient creature is unknown, but there are many theories. Some say that it is a dragon that was petrified by a powerful magic. Thus causing a collision Others say that it is a giant creature that was created by the gods. Whatever the truth may be, the ancient creature remains a mystery.

Etheria was a world of chaos and uncertainty for decades. Those who survived were quickly murdered by the monsters that followed, or left to fend for themselves. Those scattered pockets of civilization, fighting tooth and nail to stay alive.

But in time, the people of Etheria banded together and began to rebuild. They formed city-states, each ruled by a powerful lord or lady. And slowly but surely, they pushed back the monsters and began to reclaim their world. Now, after centuries of struggle, Etheria is finally at peace. But it is a fragile peace, constantly threatened by the forces of evil that lurk in the shadows.

## [Magic](/essence)
From every place in the land remaining scales of the ancient creature could be seen reaching unbelievable heights. The scales containing immense magic are almost impossible to penetrate and thus are left alone by most of the inhabitants of Etheria. But there are few that managed to pierce small gaps into the thick plates, more often than not paying it with their lives. From those gaps sparks of magic can be seen hitting the land that surrounds it. With special means cities managed to stabalize the sparks using it as a power source. Nowadays its stricly forbidden attempting to create new cavities.

The largest such cavity is located in the old ruins of an ancient kingdom, now called Kin'Darei. The ruined city is surrounded by a great moat filled with deadly creatures that are attracted to this magical place. Even if one manages to pass through all travellers are constantly hunted down and killed before they can reach the ruin's walls. Not even giants dare to enter because of what lies inside, there have been no survivors who had escaped from it telling tales about its wonders.

Some people have managed to find ways to harness the magic inside the scales. In order to do so, they need to use special tools called scalespeakers. A scalespeaker is a device that contains a crystal that resonates with the magic inside the scales. When the scalespeaker is placed over the scale, the magic inside the scale will resonate with the crystal and cause it to emit a strong beam of magic. The magic that is emitted from the scale can be used for many purposes, such as powering magical devices, or even used as a weapon. However, using the magic in this way is very dangerous and often results in death or serious injury.

## The Five Scales
Up until now there are Five [Scales](/the-scales) that penetrate the surface. But it is believed that there could be many more hidden deeply underground. A dangerous group called [The Ragged Goons](/ragged-goons) made it their sole purpose to find and exploit new (unprotected) scales.

- [The Armour of Or](/armour-of-or) (slightly red with white, largest, lowest)
	- While it is the largest scale with a crossection of about 30.000 feet, it is also the lowest. It got excavated underneath the mountain by the Flatstone family. The lands surrounding it are mostly tundra with a bit of fertile land here and there. The color is white. with a few spikes that are faintly red/orange. Underneath the armor lies the [City of Or](/city-of-or) that is Build by Dwarves
- [Batès Lamina](/bates-lamina)
	- The smallest of all scales, Its a bright red colored scale. it became a precious place to the Followers of Irion. Its sits in the middle of a lake with a city build around it, in open fields this city has barely enough defenses to protect itself.
- [Eldeviérs Shell](/eldeviers-shell)
	- The Shell is colored in a bright opal green. On this scale that mostly represents a tall looking spire the city Mohinders is build hanging suspeded in the air.  It is attached with several large iron rings that were build around the spire to give the city stability and attached at the top with iron chains. The city hangs at a height of 2000 feet and can only be reached trough magical manners. The peak of the shell has device that collects energy from the scale powering several portals to the ground.
- [Umperas Hull](/umperas-hull) (yellow)
	- A large curved scale with the top broken off, it pretty much resembles a long running wall, that curves away making for a great city surrounded by the hull, its color is a beatifull yellow with slight hints of orange.
- [The Asara Plate](/asara-plate)
	- The plate sits in the ground at a 30° angle and broke in half. Underneath the overhang of this plate runs a route, with a side road that runs between the two halves. The roads are used by merchants and travelers, it has a blue almost ice like color that shines bright when the sun hits the surface. 

- The Orinite Ring
  - A black circle with a red inner lining. It is the only scale that doesn't have any land on it and orbits around the world. It has a magical field that protects those inside from the vacuum of space.

## Religions
- **Followers of Irion**, a religious organisation that communes with the remaining spirit of the magical creature Irion that still resides in the magical scales. They use Batès Lamina as shrine's and will protect it whatever the cost.
- **Redemptious Myphos**, or more commonly known as **The Arcane Fangs** is a group of culprits that focusus on finding and exploiting magical scales. Usually for their own benefit of becoming rich or powerful. They believe that the scale's should be for everyone to use to make life easier. Some of them have obtained immense powers through different means of refining scales, and fusing them into specialized gear or even themselves.
- The **Cult of Dy** theorizes that every action and reaction by living beings is randomly determined by the three deities called Dy, who roll their magic stones to determine the outcome. Even though evidence for this is slim, the Cult of Dy has many dangerous rituals where they challenge their faith by subjecting condemned criminals and lesser animals to The Fire Trials. If luck is on their side, they are set free unconditionally.

## Organisations
- Gorgraths Wrath, a secret organzation bent on brining down the Flatstone dynasty in the City of Or
- The Sisterhood of Assassination
