# Resonant Scholar
*Sorcerer Subclass*

Some sorcerers don't simply cast spells—they are attuned to the fabric of magic itself. These Resonant Scholars understand that magic vibrates in the world like sound waves, and they manipulate this resonance to shape reality. Their connection to the harmonic frequencies of the universe allows them to weave spells with a power that flows instinctively from their being. Instead of formal incantations, their spells emanate from within, shaped by their natural connection to the cosmic hum of existence.

## Level 3: Resonant Affinity
At 3th level, your connection to the forces of resonance allows you to attune yourself to the underlying frequencies of magic. You gain the following benefits:

### Resonance Frequencies
You learn to attune yourself to a Resonance Frequency. At the end of a long rest, you can choose one of the following Frequencies. These Frequencies can be shifted at the end of a long rest, or as part of a short rest if you're exposed to strong magical fields (such as ley lines or magical phenomena), but this requires a successful *DC 15 Arcana* check to shift instantly.

- **Harmonic Flow (Sustained Magic):**
  - When you cast a spell that requires concentration, you can maintain concentration without making concentration checks for 2 rounds.
  - Spells you cast have no verbal or somatic components—they manifest instinctively. You don’t need to speak or gesture to cast them.
  - Once per long rest, you can leave behind a magical "Echo" when you cast a spell. This Echo allows you to recast the same spell as a Bonus Action without expending a spell slot. The Echo lasts for 1 minute.

- **Disruptive Wave (Countermagic):**
  - When a creature within 30 feet of you casts a spell, you can use your reaction to attempt to destabilize the magic. Roll an Arcana check against the creature's spell save DC. On a success, the spell fails, and the caster loses the spell slot.
  - Your spells cannot be countered or dispelled unless the caster succeeds on a spellcasting ability check against your spell save DC.

- **Refractive Echo (Duplicated Magic):**
  - When you cast a spell, roll a d6. On a 6, the spell is duplicated: it casts normally and again at half potency with no additional cost. The second casting has no additional effects (such as damage or healing).
  - If a spell targets one creature, you can instead target two creatures within range at the expense of a extra spell slot.

## Level 6: Resonant Adaptation
By 6th level, you have gained the ability to more easily shift between the resonances that govern your magic. You can change your Resonant Frequency in the following ways:

- **Meditation:** Once per long rest, you can spend 1 minute meditating to shift your active Resonance Frequency to another one you have already chosen.
- **Magical Field Awareness:** You can make an *Arcana* check (DC 15) to instantly shift to a new Resonance Frequency when exposed to strong magical fields, such as ley lines, enchanted artifacts, or Rift events.
- **Resonant Resistance:** You gain resistance to force damage and any damage caused by magical effects that push, pull, or restrain you (such as the *telekinesis* spell or *wall of force*).

## Level 10: Liminal State
At 10th level, your connection to the Resonance frequencies becomes so deep that you can momentarily slip between the boundaries of physical reality. You can enter a **Liminal State** for 1 minute, once per long rest. During this time, the following occurs:

- **Resonant Protection:** You gain resistance to all magical damage from spells and effects.
- **Phasing Through Reality:** You can move through non-magical barriers (such as walls, doors, or windows) as if you were incorporeal. You can pass through creatures as well, though you can't end your movement inside one.
- **Energy Absorption:** If you take damage from a spell, you can convert half of that damage into temporary hit points.

Additionally, while in the Liminal State, enemy spells that target you have disadvantage to hit you if they require an attack roll, and you can avoid the effects of harmful spells with a successful *Constitution saving throw* against the caster's spell save DC.

## Level 14: Perfect Resonance
At 14th level, you have mastered the flow of Resonance, allowing you to simultaneously channel multiple frequencies at once. You gain the following benefits:

### Dual Resonance
You can attune yourself to two Resonance Frequencies at once. The benefits of both Frequencies apply simultaneously while you maintain them, allowing you to blend their effects. For example, you could be in both **Harmonic Flow** and **Disruptive Wave** at once, sustaining spells and disrupting enemy casters.

### Resonant Absorption
When you take damage from a spell, you can harmonize with the energy and convert it into magic. The next spell you cast within 1 minute gains a special bonus effect based on the damage type you absorbed:

- **Fire Damage:** Your next spell deals extra fire damage equal to your Sorcerer level.
- **Cold Damage:** You gain temporary hit points equal to half of the cold damage absorbed.
- **Lightning Damage:** Your next spell gains an additional charge, allowing you to cast it twice at once if it’s a spell with a casting time of *1 action* (does not apply to spells with a *Concentration* duration).
- **Psychic Damage:** Your next spell deals psychic damage and gains advantage on any saving throws to maintain concentration.

## Resonance Scholar in Action
The **Resonant Scholar** subclass allows for an incredibly flexible and dynamic playstyle, giving Sorcerers the ability to adapt, disrupt, and augment their magical abilities in ways that no other subclass can. Whether you want to manipulate the flow of your spells, counter your enemies’ magic, or absorb energy to bolster your own abilities, this subclass provides rich and diverse options.

By 14th level, you'll be able to manipulate multiple frequencies, creating a very fluid and responsive form of magic that scales up with the complexity of gameplay. The flavor and thematics of "resonance" are tightly tied to both the mechanics and the roleplay of this subclass.

## Summary of Key Features:
- **Level 1:** Choose a Resonance Frequency that enhances your spellcasting in different ways, such as no verbal/somatic components, disrupting enemy spells, or duplicating your magic.
- **Level 6:** Shift between Resonance Frequencies more easily, gaining resistance to force damage and effects that manipulate you.
- **Level 10:** Enter a Liminal State to gain resistance to magical damage, phase through barriers, and absorb spell damage for temporary hit points.
- **Level 14:** Harmonize with multiple Resonance Frequencies at once and absorb energy from spells to enhance your own magic.
