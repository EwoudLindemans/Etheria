# The Headmaster’s Roost (Administration Tower)*
A **tall, imposing tower** that serves as the headquarters for **Barty Dunderfield**, the Rift’s *completely unqualified* but **well-meaning** leader.  

- He has **no magical ability whatsoever**, but he’s excellent at spotting **potential** in others.  
- His office is filled with **stacks of paperwork, half-empty teacups, and exactly one magical artifact he *should not* be handling**.  
- Most students believe he **bluffed his way into power**, and honestly? They might be right.  

Despite his **total lack of arcane knowledge**, Barty remains a **surprisingly effective** administrator. Mostly.
