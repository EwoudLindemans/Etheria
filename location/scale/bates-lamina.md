# Batès Lamina
The smallest of all scales, Its a bright red colored [scale](/location/scale.md). it became a precious place to the Followers of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md). Its sits in the middle of a lake with a city build around it, in open fields this city has barely enough defenses to protect itself. This poses no problems though, because the Followers of Irion  are peaceful and well respected by their neighbours. They are also a religious people, and the shrine at the centre of their city is the most important place in the world to them.

People from all over the world travel to the shrine to bring offers of wine and fruits, and to say prayers for good fortune. The Followers of [Irion](/being/deity/irion.md) believe that the magical creature, Irion, speaks to them through the magical scales that are best accessible through a cavity in the center of the shrine. The Followers of Irion have a strict non-political policy that has led to their city being a neutral ground for many years.
