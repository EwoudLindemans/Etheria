# The Ornite Ring

In the vast emptiness of space, a black circle with a red inner lining orbited around the world. The Orinite Ring, as it was known, was a marvel of [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and engineering. Its magical field protected those inside from the harsh vacuum of space and slowed down time, giving its occupants a unique perspective of the world below.

It was said that from the Orinite Ring, one could see the entire planet at once. The experience was both awe-inspiring and humbling. The slow passage of time within the ring made it a popular destination for those seeking a respite from the hurried pace of life on the planet below.

The Orinite Ring was a place of wonder and mystery, but also of danger. The magical field that protected it from the vacuum of space was not infallible, and on occasion, breaches in the field would occur.

Despite the danger, the Orinite Ring remained a popular destination for adventurers and explorers, drawn to its unique perspective and the chance to witness the beauty of the world from a distance. For those who dared to venture within its walls, the Orinite Ring held the promise of adventure and discovery, but also the risk of death and danger.
