# The Echo Halls (Dormitories & Learning Spaces)
A constantly shifting labyrinth of **dorms, classrooms, and study halls** where students **live, study, and argue about [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md)**.  
Due to its **Echo System**, no two students have identical dorm experiences, creating a bizarre mix of wisdom, chaos, and *near-daily existential crises*.  

- The hallways **rearrange themselves overnight**, meaning students **frequently wake up somewhere new**.  
- Some rooms have **mysterious, unopenable doors**, and no one knows why.  

Despite the **occasional teleportation mishap**, the Echo Halls remain the **center of student life**, buzzing with [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) and confusion.
