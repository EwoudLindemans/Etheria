## **Item: The Library Between Names**  
*Wondrous Item (unique), legendary, soulbound*

This unassuming leather-bound tome appears to most as a blank journal, worn but well-maintained, with no title upon its cover. The spine bears only a single embossed symbol: a quill crossed over a half-mask. 

To any reader save its true author or chosen heir, the pages remain utterly empty—resisting ink, [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), or scrying. The enchantment binding the book is woven from layered illusions, subtle soul-threading, and a deep [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md) with the identity of the one known as *[Tallis Thorne](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/tallis-thorne.md)*—and, more crucially, the one *he was before*.

### **Properties:**

- **Soulbound Sincerity**  
  Only [Tallis Thorne](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/tallis-thorne.md) can view, write, or alter its true contents. Others see only blank parchment.

- **Conditional Revelation**  
  Upon the confirmed death of [Tallis Thorne](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/tallis-thorne.md), the book may reveal its contents *once*—but only to the individual he has designated as his *Narrative Heir*. This person must present one of the following:  
  - A signed page containing Tallis’s true name  
  - A keepsake of shared importance bound in his essence (such as a harp string from Gloriana or a journal fragment)  
  - Or the answer to a riddle only Tallis and the heir would know (e.g., *“What name did I give the owl who wasn’t mine?”*)

- **Memory Seal**  
  Until the correct heir opens it, the book cannot be copied, quoted, or remembered in detail by any who glance at it—even momentarily.

- **Scribe of the Self**  
  While attuned, Tallis can summon the book to his side with a whispered phrase:  
  > *“I forget myself, therefore I write.”*  
  The book will resist any other command.

- **Final Page**  
  The last page is always blank, except for a glowing line that reads:  
  > *“The story only ends if you stop telling it.”*

### **Failsafe Trigger – The False Memoirs of Tallis Thorne**

If opened prematurely or by an unauthorised reader, *The Library Between Names* activates **Thorne’s Veil**, a deeply woven illusion designed to obscure its real contents.

#### *“The Illustrated Life of the Honourable (and Occasionally Humble) Tallis Thorne, Master of Absolutely Everything”*

This false memoir is a dazzling, absurdly exaggerated account of Tallis's fabricated life, including:

- Being born from a falling star into the arms of a dragon-midwife.  
- A romantic relationship with the personification of Time.  
- Rule over a moon made entirely of enchanted cheese.  
- Founding the University of Exaggerated Truths, where students duel with metaphors.

The book is filled with footnotes from *“Future Tallis”* correcting *“Past Tallis”*, and spellbound illustrations that animate dramatically when the reader yawns.

**Magical Effects:**  
- All divinations show the text as true.  
- All insight checks fail unless made by someone with a deep, personal connection to Tallis.  
- Attempts to remove or alter the book trigger bardic illusions, sarcasm, and increasingly rude musical notes.
