# Background: The Truth Between the Tales  
*A Narrated Account of What Is Known, Suspected, and Almost Remembered about Tallis' past*

## A Mask of Legend

Though the name [Tallis Thorne](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/tallis-thorne.md) resounds through every festival, footnote, and flamboyant songbook, the *true* story behind the bard is far more guarded—and infinitely more fragile. Tallis presents himself as a creature of glory, self-fashioned myth, and poetic thunder, but beneath that persona lies the quieter life of a man once named simply **Tallis**.

Those few who knew him *before* remember a selfless, bright, and quietly loyal soul—one who routinely downplayed his own achievements in favour of his companions. His legendary persona is not a lie, but a **deliberate deflection**. A mask of mirth built to endure the unbearable weight of injustice, loss, and helpless love for a world that often breaks the good before it honours them.

## On Cowardice and Courage

Contrary to the loud confidence, **[Tallis Thorne](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/tallis-thorne.md) has never been a coward.**  
His fear is real, his avoidance of certain topics sincere—but his bravery lies in the quiet decisions. The lies told to protect others. The spotlight avoided when it would shine too harshly on a painful truth. He fights with wit, endures with elegance, and hides his wounds behind stage lights and applause.

## The Split: Tallis vs. Tallis Thorne

The shift from *Tallis* to *[Tallis Thorne](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/tallis-thorne.md)* was not a single event, but a slow metamorphosis born of necessity. Somewhere between loss, survival, and legend-building, he divided himself in two:

- **Tallis**, the man—earnest, vulnerable, and haunted by things he won't name.  
- **[Tallis Thorne](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/tallis-thorne.md)**, the bard—brilliant, boundless, untouchable.

The space between them is filled with stories, songs, and spectacular distractions. To him, that library of invention is a safe distance.

## Gloriana and the Lost Friend

At the centre of Tallis’s unspoken sorrow is Gloriana, his twelve-string lyre harp. Most believe she was earned, crafted, or stolen in some whimsical Tallis-worthy tale. In truth, she **once belonged to someone else**—a dear friend whose name no longer echoes in any corner of [Etheria](/etheria.md).

She is not dead. She is **erased**—removed so thoroughly from the weave of memory and time that even Tallis no longer remembers her face. But his heart does. The emotional bond remains, anchored unknowingly in Gloriana, who remembers *everything*. To others, she is simply a magical harp. To Tallis, she is the last thread to something lost.

Gloriana may even hold the key to breaking the curse—though Tallis has no idea.

## The Song He Doesn’t Know

In quiet moments, Tallis plays a nameless melody. He does not recall composing it. He does not speak of it. He simply plays it, always the same, alone. The strings glow soft blue. Gloriana listens.

[Miss Terry](/being/character/miss-terry.md), one of the very few to witness this performance, refers to it as:

> **“The Song He Doesn’t Know.”**

She has never spoken of it aloud, and if anyone draws too close during the performance, she reliably causes a distraction to keep the secret safe.

## The Elven Ranger

Occasionally, Tallis is seen in the company of an elderly, grey-haired **elven ranger**, a former adventuring companion from the days when Tallis was still just himself. In these rare meetings, the mask slips. His posture changes. His speech quiets. He becomes less bard, more man.

The two speak in murmurs, often sharing books, memories, and silences. Those who know what to look for can see that this friendship is sacred—a thread of his true past allowed to survive the whirlwind of his public persona.

## Miss Terry and the Pact of Silence

If there is one soul other than Gloriana who truly understands Tallis, it is **[Miss Terry](/being/character/miss-terry.md)**. Their history remains a mystery, but their understanding runs deeper than jest and jabs.

Out of a love built on respect and understanding, [Miss Terry](/being/character/miss-terry.md) has sworn herself—formally or not—to the protection of Tallis’s truths. She guards them fiercely, turning away eavesdroppers, redirecting conversation, and never speaking of what he hides.

Their friendship is one of laughter and legend. But it is also a bond built on silence and trust.

## The Real Memoir: The Library Between Names

Hidden behind Tallis’s jokes about “writing the greatest memoir of all time” lies a very real, very secret book: The Library Between Names

A soul-bound tome only Tallis can read or write. Upon his death, it will reveal itself only to his chosen Narrative Heir. It contains the true story—the one even Tallis is still afraid to finish writing.

Should anyone attempt to read it early, they will instead awaken the enchanted failsafe:  
> **“The False Memoirs of Tallis Thorne”**—a ludicrous tale of moon empires, cheese diplomacy, and time-born romances.

## Final Thought

[Tallis Thorne](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or/local/tallis-thorne.md), for all his exaggeration, is not a liar.

He simply chose a version of himself the world could handle.

And buried the truth behind the laughter.
