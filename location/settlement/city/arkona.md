# Arkona
The City of Arkona is one of the most powerful in all of Etheria. It is ruled by Lady Arkona, a ruthless and ambitious woman who will stop at nothing to increase her power. The people of Arkona live in fear of her wrath, but they are also fiercely loyal to their city.

## Trade
Arkona is a bustling metropolis, home to tens of thousands of people. It is a center of trade and commerce, and its streets are always filled with people going about their business. The city is well defended, and its walls have never been breached.

## Iron fist
Lady Arkona rules over Arkona with an iron fist. She is a cold and calculating woman who cares only for herself and her own power. She tolerates no dissent or disobedience, and those who cross her often meet with a swift and brutal end.
