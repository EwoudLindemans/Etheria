# Gutterbrew Alley

> *“If it fizzes and glows, drink slow.”*

## Overview
**Gutterbrew Alley** is a narrow, twisting corridor of alchemical chaos wedged between **Coalwalk Row** and **The Spillway** in the City of Or. Unclaimed by either district and officially absent from all city maps, the alley is a haven for **experimental brewers, rogue potion-makers, and fringe alchemists**.

Locals describe it as "too strange to be ours" and "exactly where it belongs." Though short in length, it is rich in lore, odour, and questionable legality.

## Geography & Access
- **Location:** A sloped passage between Coalwalk Row and The Spillway  
- **Claimed by:** No official district  
- **Notable Feature:** Constant aromatic haze from potion steam and bubbling street stills

Despite being unclaimed, Gutterbrew Alley sees heavy foot traffic, especially during festival seasons, when hopeful brewers test their concoctions on drunk council hopefuls and brave wanderers.

## Inhabitants & Establishments
- **Alley Regulars:** Goblin brewers, exiled gnomish inventors, alchemical smugglers, and washed-up university dropouts.
- **Drinks Served:** “Rootsnarl,” “Doublebitter Blast,” “Spicequake Draft,” and “Oops! All Ether”
- **Shops:** No permanent shops, but dozens of pop-up stalls with enchanted signage appear and disappear daily.

## Cultural Notes
- **Law Enforcement:** Patrols avoid the alley unless extremely bored or extremely brave.
- **Legends:** It's said the alley produces a new colour of fire once a month, and no two torches burn the same way.
- **Rumour:** A secret door in the alley leads to a forgotten lab belonging to one of the first post-Collapse artificers.
