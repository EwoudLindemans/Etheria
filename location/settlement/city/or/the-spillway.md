# The Spillway

> *“If it’s not in motion, it’s in the way.”*

## Overview
**The Spillway** is one of the busiest districts in the [City of Or](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or), functioning as a **transit corridor, trade artery, and pressure valve** between the surface world and the underground heart of the city. It is a place of ramps, cargo sleds, shouting merchants, and overworked lifters.

Straddling the vertical axis of Or, the Spillway connects the Hearthring, [Coalwalk Row](/location/settlement/city/or/coalwalk-row), [Gutterbrew Alley](/location/settlement/city/or/gutterbrew-alley), and various freight routes toward deeper forgeworks.

## Terrain & Infrastructure
- **Design:** Steep inclines, metal-reinforced ramps, and pulley-driven cargo lines  
- **Climate:** Warm from below, cold from above—causing frequent magical fogs  
- **Sounds:** Yelling, chain creaks, horn blasts, and the constant roll of crates

## District Character
- **People:** Dock workers, scribes, couriers, traders, pulley engineers, alchemical freight runners  
- **Mood:** Frantic but weirdly efficient  
- **Function:** Moving goods, gossip, and bureaucracy faster than anywhere else

## Economy
- **Goods:** Raw ore, crafted weapons, magical items, contraband, foodstuffs from surface farms  
- **Services:** Translation, transport, registry scribes, emergency healing for “shipment injuries”

## Notable Features
- **The Echohook Platforms:** Where freight is fastened, sorted, and redirected by shouting teams with enchanted clipboards  
- **Turntunnel 3:** A spiralling freight elevator so loud it has its own curse-suppressing ward  
- **The Paperblock:** A stone wall used to slam-stamp freight permits with rune-ink (sometimes done dramatically for effect)

## Cultural Insight
The Spillway is less a district and more a living mechanism. People here don’t linger—they move, shout, sweat, and vanish down the next ramp. Those who thrive in the Spillway often become indispensable intermediaries for every corner of Or.
