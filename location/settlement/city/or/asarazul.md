# Asarazul

Long before the [City of Or](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or.md) was a name whispered through the mountain halls, and long before the undercity glowed red beneath the [Scale](/location/scale.md), there was a gem—cut from the frozen depths of the **[Asara Plate](/location/scale/asara-plate.md)**, said to hold the stillness of a thousand winters.

This gem, **Asarazul**, is not officially acknowledged by the [Council of Or](/location/settlement/city/or/council-of-or.md). But among dwarves—particularly those of the **Flatstone lineage**—its story endures like a well-worn chisel.

Forged in a time of quiet conflict and silent trade, the gem was believed to have been hewn by the **dwarves of the [Asara Plate](/location/scale/asara-plate.md)** during an age when [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md) was newly stirring in the veins of the Scales. Though the records of that era are fractured, fragments of song and stonewall etchings suggest Asarazul passed through **many hands and several borders**, sometimes as a peace offering, other times as plunder.

By the time **[Or Flatstone](/location/settlement/city/or/or-flatstone.md)** founded the first shafts beneath what would become the [City of Or](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or.md), the gem had already lived through **wars, marriages, exoduses**, and perhaps betrayals. How it came into Or’s possession is a matter of speculation. Some say he **won it in a wager of iron and verse**, others claim it was gifted by a dying Asaran stonelord who foresaw Or’s legacy.

What is known—at least by those who claim to know anything at all—is that the gem has **remained with the Flatstone family** for many generations. In whispered tones, dwarves refer to it as **Asarazul**, a name old enough to be both reverent and dangerous. A name meaning *“deep-blue truth”* in the dialect of ancient forge-singers.

Many believe it rests in a vault near the [Heartforge](/location/settlement/city/or/heartforge.md), sealed in mirrored stone and guarded not by lock or law, but by tradition and taboo. If it hums with [resonance](/structure/mechanic/resonance.md), or sings to the other Scales, only a select few have ever heard it.

And yet... some claim they’ve seen it. A glimmer in a councillor’s pocket. A ghostlight in the hands of a child on Election Day. A reflection in the tankard of an old bard who talks too much and remembers too well.

**Asarazul** may be a relic. It may be a myth. But to the dwarves of Or, it is something far more dangerous: **a symbol with a name.**
