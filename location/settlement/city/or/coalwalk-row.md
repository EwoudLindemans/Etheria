# Coalwalk Row

## Overview
**Coalwalk Row** is a rugged residential and working-class district carved into the mountainside above The Deepforge. Once a hub of miner housing, it has evolved into a **multi-racial, low-cost quarter** known for its resilience, loud street life, and unpretentious charm.

It borders both [Gutterbrew Alley](/location/settlement/city/or/gutterbrew-alley) and The Hearthring, and is a critical zone for cultural interaction within the [City of Or](/location/settlement/city/city-of-or).

## Character
- **Vibe:** Loud, lived-in, and hard-working  
- **Residents:** Dwarves, humans, half-orcs, halflings, dragonborn—anyone who’s more practical than posh  
- **Economy:** Mostly residential, but [home](/home) to a variety of independent smiths, scrappers, tutors, and tavern runners

## Architecture
Buildings are carved from layered stone and reinforced with scavenged forge iron. Shutters and signage are mismatched, and colourful cloth awnings stretch between dwellings like low-hanging skies.

## Community Life
- **Street Events:** Night arguments that turn into musical debates; alley ball games; rooftop echo duels  
- **Famous For:** Homebrew competitions, loud families, and civic passion  
- **Slogan:** *“If you don’t yell it, it doesn’t count.”*

## Relationship with Other Districts
- **Hearthring:** Many Coalwalkers commute here for work and drink  
- **[Gutterbrew Alley](/location/settlement/city/or/gutterbrew-alley):** Considered someone else’s problem, but secretly beloved  
- **Spillway:** Supplies most of its workers; the two districts have a love–grumble relationship

## Notable Locations
- **The Ashcup Hearth:** Communal oven used for cooking, heating, and impromptu political debates  
- **The Cleftstep Market:** Selling used tools, street food, and questionable heirlooms  
- **Tenbrew House:** A rotating open-tap bar with no fixed menu and no posted prices
