# **Runeswindler, Collector of Passage**  
![runeswindler.png](/characters/runeswindler.webp =500x)

In [Mohinders](/location/settlement/city/mohinders.md), travel is not a right—it is a privilege **taxed, monitored, and controlled** by the **Council of Controlled Magical Appliance**. At the heart of this lucrative system stands the **Runeswindler**, an Kavrethul responsible for ensuring **no portal functions without payment**.  

---

## **Role and Methods**  
- Every portal leading **into, out of, or within** [Mohinders](/location/settlement/city/mohinders.md) is subject to a **toll**, paid in **gold, favors, or secrets**. The Runeswindler ensures compliance, embedding the city's magical gateways with **invisible sigils** that detect and enforce these payments.  
- Attempting to bypass a **Runeswindler’s toll** is **a fool’s errand**—portals they control do not simply vanish; they **disguise themselves** as walls, doors, or even mundane objects, making unauthorized travel **nearly impossible**.  
- Those who try to **cheat the system** may find their portals leading **elsewhere**—into **sealed pocket dimensions**, endless **looping corridors**, or even into **empty voids where time ceases to exist**.  

---

## **Forms of Payment**  
- **Coin:** The simplest method—those who can afford the **exorbitant portal taxes** move freely. Wealthier citizens may pay for **"unrestricted access" sigils**, granting passage for a set period.  
- **Favors:** The Council is always in need of **agents, informants, and pawns**. Those without gold may enter into **binding contracts**, enforced by [magic](/structure/mechanic/magic.md), to settle their debts.  
- **Secrets:** Some portals require **knowledge** rather than coin. A whispered truth, a hidden weakness, or a confession of **forbidden knowledge** may grant access—for a price.  

---

## **Enforcement & Punishments**  
The Runeswindler has no need for brute force—**their punishments are woven into the city itself**. Those who defy the portal tolls may find:  
- Their **businesses inaccessible**, with shop doors leading to **distant alleyways** instead of customers.  
- Their **homes unreachable**, as their front door now connects to the **wrong side of the city**.  
- Their **entire existence rerouted**, forcing them to wander through **illusory pathways** with no escape until they **submit and pay their due**.  

---

## **The Unseen Gatekeeper**  
The **Runeswindler’s true identity is unknown to most**. They rarely appear in their fiendish form, instead working through a network of **masked enforcers, arcane automata, and illusionary messengers**. Most citizens know only of the system—the **tolls, the taxes, the rules**—and they obey, because the alternative is **being lost in a labyrinth of false paths and vanished streets**.  

---

## **Rumors & Dissent**  
Despite the Council's **iron grip on portal travel**, whispers of **a hidden resistance** circulate in back alleys and shadowed halls. Some claim that **a rogue mage** is unraveling the Runeswindler’s enchantments, crafting **counterfeit sigils** to bypass the tolls. Others say that the Runeswindler **collects more than just secrets**—that they are hoarding knowledge of a **portal leading beyond the Shell itself**, to **something even the Council fears**.  

One thing remains certain—**if you want to go anywhere in [Mohinders](/location/settlement/city/mohinders.md), you must pay the Runeswindler’s price.**
