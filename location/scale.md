# Scale
In the world of Etheria, a **scale** is not merely a remnant of a creature—it is a foundation of reality itself. These vast, nearly indestructible structures are the shattered fragments of Irion, a magical entity whose collision with the world during The Collapse fractured both the planet and the being into a thousand immense, interlocking pieces. These fragments—called **scales**—now tower over the landscape, each one infused with Irion’s lingering resonance magic. Their presence reshaped existence: altering terrain, warping weather, and anchoring civilization in a world reborn through chaos. The land healed around them, growing anew in the shadow of their arcane permanence.

## Properties
- **Immensity**: Most scales stretch hundreds to thousands of feet in diameter, towering like mountains or embedded deep underground.
- **Indestructibility**: The material of a scale is almost impervious to most known tools or magic. Only small gaps or cavities exist—likely created shortly after the Collapse—through which raw magical energy sometimes leaks.
- **Magical Pulse**: Scales are not static. They resonate with the magical fabric of the world, producing fluctuations known as the **Aurorhythmic Resonance Cycle (ARC)**. These pulses define the flow of time and magic throughout Etheria.
- **Environmental Influence**: Proximity to a scale alters the world around it—rivers may run uphill, forests may breathe, and light may twist in impossible ways.

## Cultural & Civilizational Impact

### Scale Sanctuaries

In the wake of the Collapse, scattered survivors quickly realized that areas near scales were safer. These **scale sanctuaries** emitted calming energy that repelled chaotic creatures and destructive magic. Early settlements were built around these zones, eventually growing into cities and nations.

### Architectural Integration

The physical size of the scales made them ideal natural fortifications. Cities like the City of Or were constructed beneath or beside them, using the scale's surface as walls, roofs, or bridges. Architecture melded with nature and magic, birthing a new style of scale-bound civilization.

### Scale Conduits

Over time, scholars and artisans learned to **channel the latent magic** of scales through conduits—devices or rituals designed to extract energy without harming the scale. This practice led to a form of **scale-tech**, a magical-industrial revolution that powers lighting, transportation, communication, and even warfare in some regions.

However, the creation of new scale cavities is strictly forbidden. Any attempt to bore into the surface of a scale risks unleashing wild, unstable magic, or worse—awakening some forgotten resonance deep within.

## Religious Significance

To many, the scales are sacred.

- **Followers of Irion** treat them as the resting body of their god, especially revering sites like Batès Lamina.
- Others believe the scales are sentient or dreaming, and that tampering with them risks invoking a second Collapse.
- Some, like the Cult of Dy, attribute randomness and divine will to the patterns of resonance the scales emit.

## Conflict & Exploitation

While most of Etheria respects the power and danger of scales, not all do.

Groups like the Ragged Goons actively seek out hidden or unprotected scales, attempting to exploit them for wealth, power, or chaos. These excavations often end in disaster—unleashing bursts of magical radiation, spawning monstrous entities, or warping the land around them.

## Known Scales

There are **five known surface-penetrating scales**, each distinct in form and function:

- **Armour of Or**: The largest known scale, resting beneath a mountain. White with red crystalline spikes. Powers the forges of the City of Or.
- **Batès Lamina**: Bright red and smallest in size, sits in a lake. Revered by the Followers of Irion.
- **Eldeviérs Shell**: A tall, opal-green spire with healing light. Suspends the city of Mohinders.
- **Umperas Hull**: A curved yellow wall-like structure, broken at the top. Serves as a defensive perimeter.
- **Asara Plate**: A broken blue scale angled into a scenic overhang, known for its dazzling light shows.
- **Orinite Ring**: The only known celestial scale, orbiting Etheria in the sky—black with a glowing red lining.

## Mysteries of the Scales

- Are there more hidden underground?
- Are the scales aware of those who live around them?
- Could the scales ever be awakened?
- What happens if two scales are brought into resonance with one another?

The answers remain unclear. The scales are not just remnants—they are Etheria's bones, its memory, and perhaps its future.
