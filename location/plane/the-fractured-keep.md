# The Fractured Keep

## The Fracture Realm
The **Fractured Keep** is a hidden dimension that formed as a byproduct of the Collapse—the event where Irion collided with Etheria. As magic surged and reality buckled, not all rifts sealed cleanly. Some **shattered further**, creating a liminal, paradoxical realm between planes. 

This place is neither the Elemental Chaos nor the Dense. It is a **temporal echo**, layered with the discarded possibilities and unstable prototypes of what Etheria *might have become*. Magic within the Fracture Realm is wild, volatile, and often folds in on itself—creating sentient landscapes, recursive beings, and thoughts that remember *you* before you think them.

## Broken Etheria – The Mirror Echo
During the magical surge, a glimpse of a fractured version of Etheria was seen:
- The **Orinite Ring shattered**, spiraling like a cyclone across the sky.
- Cities hover mid-air, tethered to floating scale fragments.
- Magic is uncontrolled and omnipresent; it reshapes buildings, minds, and even identity.

## Shard of the Fracture Realm (Artifact – Attuned)
- **Wildcast (1/day)**: Roll 1d100 and cast a random spell from the Wild Magic Table.
- **Fractured Switch**: On a natural 1 with any d20, A character in the normal realm **switch places** with their counterpart in the Fracture Realm for 1 minute. Unless it does not exist or is deceased.
- **Fracture Whispers**: During high magical strain (e.g. surges, fails, chaos), the Fracture Realm version may speak to the normal character in cryptic hints.
