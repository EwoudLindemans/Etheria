# Iridian ‚Äì The Scale-Touched
"We were never meant to be. Yet the world willed us into existence."

## Origin & Birth
Iridian are not born through conventional means. Instead, they form naturally when a surge of raw magic escapes from a scale‚Äôs cavity, drawing in nearby organic matter, elemental energy, and remnants of past life into a new, sentient being. These events‚Äîcalled Manifestations‚Äîare rare, and many Iridian do not remember their creation.

Though all Iridia originate from a scale, they are not bound to it. Some Iridian retain the properties of the scale where they manifested, while others change over time, adapting to the magic of a different scale if they spend long enough near it.

### A Body of Many Origins
Each Iridian is unique, shaped by the forces present at their creation. Some might have faint glowing patterns across their skin, while others carry the scent of the land or the hum of distant energy within them. Some might have hardened skin like bark, others might carry a faint aura of warmth or static, and a few might even have an unnatural fluidity to their movements, as if slightly disconnected from the rules of the world.

Unlike many magically created beings, they do not require magic to survive.

## Biology & Physiology

Iridian resemble humanoid beings but possess a unique ability to resonate with the Scale they are closest to. Rather than merely adapting, their bodies and souls vibrate in harmony with the essence of their surroundings. Their skin, eyes, and even internal composition subtly shift in response to these energies, making them a living reflection of the magic around them.

###  **Shifting Veil**
This resonance is not a simple physical transformation but a deep, intrinsic attunement‚Äîan echo of the Scale‚Äôs frequency within their very being. As they move through different Scales, the Iridian experience gradual shifts, their form and abilities evolving in response to the dominant magical currents that surround them.

#### **Attunement & Shifting**
- Iridian attune to the **resonance** of a Scale, adapting their traits to match.  
- They can **meditate** for one hour to shift attunement to any Scale they have previously experienced.  
- However, the shift takes **24 hours** to fully settle before they can change again.  

#### **Proximity Override**
- If an Iridian gets close to a Scale, their body **automatically begins adjusting**.  
- After **one hour**, this new resonance **overrides** their current attunement.  

#### **Shifting Adaptation**
- While attuned to a Scale, Iridian gain a feat tied to that Scale‚Äôs nature.  

### Coloration & Form
No two Iridian are exactly alike. Each carries a unique appearance, shaped by the Scale they resonate with. Their coloration, texture, and even the subtle glow of their veins shift based on the magical essence they have attuned to.

An Iridian who has spent time near Bat√®s Lamina may develop a faint crimson sheen in their skin, while one who resonated with Eldevi√©rs Shell might shimmer with opalescent hues. Some retain the form they were created with, remaining unchanged throughout their lives, while others gradually shift, their bodies reflecting the lingering echoes of past attunements.

### Senses & Perception

Due to their unique origin, Iridian have a subtle ability to sense magic around them. They can often feel shifts in the land, detect places where magic is strong or weak, and instinctively know the presence of a scale if they are close to one.
This does not grant them full magical sight, but rather a deep intuition about the world.
Reproduction
