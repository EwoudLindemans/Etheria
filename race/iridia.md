# The Iridia – The Scale-Touched
"We were never meant to be. Yet the world willed us into existence."

## Origins & Birth
The Iridia are not born through conventional means. Instead, they form naturally when a surge of raw magic escapes from a scale’s cavity, drawing in nearby organic matter, elemental energy, and remnants of past life into a new, sentient being. These events—called Manifestations—are rare, and many Iridia do not remember their creation.

Though all Iridia originate from a scale, they are not bound to it. Some Iridia retain the properties of the scale where they manifested, while others change over time, adapting to the magic of a different scale if they spend long enough near it.

Each Iridia is unique, shaped by the forces present at their creation. Some might have faint glowing patterns across their skin, while others carry the scent of the land or the hum of distant energy within them.

## Biology & Physiology
Ever-Adaptive Nature
Iridia resemble humanoid beings but adapt based on the scale they are closest to. Their skin, eyes, and even internal composition subtly shift in response to their environment, making them a living reflection of the magic around them.

### Coloration & Form

An Iridia’s coloration is influenced by the magic they were near during their most recent transformation.
If one was near Batès Lamina, they might have a faint red glow in their veins. If they spent years by Eldeviérs Shell, their body might emit an opal shimmer.
Some remain fixed in the form they were created with, while others shift slowly over time.
A Body of Many Origins

Iridia are biological beings but are shaped by the magic of their birth.
Some might have hardened skin like bark, others might carry a faint aura of warmth or static, and a few might even have an unnatural fluidity to their movements, as if slightly disconnected from the rules of the world.
Unlike many magically created beings, they do not require scales or magic to survive, making them playable in any setting.
Senses & Perception

Due to their unique origin, Iridia have a subtle ability to sense magic around them. They can often feel shifts in the land, detect places where magic is strong or weak, and instinctively know the presence of a scale if they are close to one.
This does not grant them full magical sight, but rather a deep intuition about the world.
Reproduction

Iridia do not reproduce through conventional means. Instead, new Iridia manifest naturally from the magic of the world, though some believe that strong-willed Iridia can leave behind an echo of themselves that influences a future Manifestation.
This means there is no Iridia bloodline—each one is completely distinct, with no concept of parentage or ancestry.
Racial Traits (D&D Playable Version)
Ability Score Increase
+2 to any one Ability Score, +1 to another (to reflect their adaptable nature).

### Size
Iridia range between 5 to 7 feet tall, though their build varies greatly. They are considered Medium creatures.

### Speed
Base walking speed: 30 ft.

### Magicborn Intuition
Iridia can sense magic in the environment. As an action, they may focus their senses to detect magical energies, ley lines, or places of power within 30 feet. This does not reveal spell details but gives them a general awareness of magic in the area.

##  **Shifting Veil**

Iridia do not simply adapt to their environment; they **resonate** with it. Their bodies and souls act as living instruments, attuning to the fundamental vibrations of the Scale they inhabit.

### **Attunement & Shifting**
- Iridia attune to the **resonance** of a Scale, adapting their traits to match.  
- They can **meditate** for one hour to shift attunement to any Scale they have previously experienced.  
- However, the shift takes **24 hours** to fully settle before they can change again.  

### **Proximity Override**
- If an Iridia enters a new Scale, their body **automatically begins adjusting**.  
- After **one hour**, this new resonance **overrides** their current attunement.  

### **Shifting Veil – Resistance Adaptation**
- While attuned to a Scale, Iridia gain a **resistance** tied to that Scale’s nature.  
- If their resonance shifts, this resistance **gradually changes over the next hour**.
