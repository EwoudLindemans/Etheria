# Irion
The creature that collapsed with the world Etheria is called Irion. The origin of Irion is unknown, but there are many theories about what it may be. Some say that it is a dragon that was petrified by powerful magic, while others say that it is a giant creature created by the gods. Whatever the truth may be, Irion remains a mystery and its impact on the world is still felt today.

## Residue
With time Etheria healed through the magical residue that the creature left behind.
The magical essence of the creature is what gives Etheria its unique properties. It is a world that is alive and constantly changing. The land itself is alive and has a will of its own. The rivers flow with magical energy, and the trees grow to impossible heights. Even the air itself is thick with magic. It is a world that is in constant flux, and it is this magic that makes the connection between Iron en Etheria so special.
