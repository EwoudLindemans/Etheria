# Vorr’Gul – The Stormforged Leviathan  
*"Lightning does not strike twice. It strikes a thousand times, until nothing remains."*  

## **Origins & Legend**  
Vorr’Gul is a walking storm, a living cataclysm forged in the heart of an eternal tempest. Created by an ancient civilization obsessed with harnessing the raw fury of the skies, Vorr’Gul was meant to be the ultimate weapon—a living conduit of endless energy. But the storm is not meant to be controlled. When his creators sought to chain the lightning within him, he turned against them, reducing their cities to smoldering ruins and vanishing into the sky, a vengeful force beyond mortality.  

Now, Vorr’Gul roams the world, a wandering thunderhead with no master. His body crackles with boundless power, his voice the roar of the storm, his rage a bolt that sunders mountains.  

## **Physical Description**  
- **Height:** 30 feet tall  
- **Weight:** Incorporeal in parts, shifting between solid form and storm energy  
- **Appearance:** A towering giant composed of darkened steel and storm-forged muscle, his body flickering between flesh and raw electricity. Arcs of lightning dance across his form, illuminating intricate storm runes carved into his plated exoskeleton. His chest is a hollow vortex, a swirling maelstrom of pure energy.  
- **Eyes:** Twin crackling orbs of blue-white lightning, flaring with every movement.  
- **Arms & Hands:** His left arm is wreathed in permanent lightning, a gauntlet of living plasma that can incinerate anything it touches. His right arm wields the **Tempest Fang**, a massive spear of crystallized storm energy, constantly shifting between solid metal and crackling plasma.  

## **Abilities & Traits**  
### **Living Storm**  
Vorr’Gul is never truly solid—his form shifts between flesh and storm, allowing him to phase through physical attacks while unleashing devastating electrical strikes.  

### **Thunderborn Resilience**  
His body absorbs lightning and thunder energy, converting it into raw power. Magical lightning heals him instead of harming him.  

### **Stormstride**  
Vorr’Gul does not walk—he moves with the wind. He can teleport up to 60 feet in a flash of lightning.  

### **Cyclone Pulse** *(Recharge 5-6)*  
With a snap of his fingers, Vorr’Gul summons a localized tornado, lifting enemies off the ground and hurling them across the battlefield.  

### **Wrath of the Tempest** *(Recharge 6)*  
Vorr’Gul calls down a storm of devastation, summoning bolts of lightning in a 200-foot radius. Everything in the area is struck, burned, and shattered by the relentless onslaught.  

## **Temperament & Behavior**  
Vorr’Gul is wild and unpredictable, much like the storm itself. He is neither good nor evil—only destructive, a force of nature that does not concern itself with mortal affairs. He is drawn to sources of great power, sensing them like a storm sensing heat, and he often tests those who dare to challenge him. Some scholars believe he is searching for a true rival, someone strong enough to contain or even surpass his storm-born fury.  

## **The Mystery of Vorr’Gul**  
Some say Vorr’Gul is the last remnant of an ancient experiment gone wrong, while others believe he is a fragment of a god’s wrath, a storm given form and fury. Those who seek to control him always meet the same fate—reduced to cinders, their ambitions lost to the howling winds.
