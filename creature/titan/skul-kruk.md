# Skul’Kruk – The Fossil Crusher  
*"Bones of the past, weapons of the future. The earth does not forget, and neither does he."*  

## **Origins & Legend**  
Skul’Kruk is the last of his kind, a colossal entity born from the remains of ancient behemoths and infused with the essence of war itself. Crafted in an age long past by orcish shamans and warlords, he was meant to be the ultimate weapon—a walking monument to destruction, carrying the strength of fallen titans in every bone and muscle. But when the wars ended and his creators were lost to time, Skul’Kruk remained, his purpose uncertain, his rage eternal.  

Some say he is cursed to wander the lands, searching for battle to give meaning to his existence. Others whisper that he is waiting for a new master, a warlord worthy of wielding his fury.  

## **Physical Description**  
- **Height:** 25 feet tall  
- **Weight:** Several dozen tons, his body composed of fossilized remains and enchanted marrow  
- **Appearance:** A towering juggernaut of fused bones and petrified flesh, his body resembling a graveyard reforged into a warrior’s form. Ancient runes glow dimly across his plated ribcage, and cracks in his fossilized exterior pulse with raw magical energy.  
- **Eyes:** Hollow sockets burning with spectral green flames, remnants of the warlocks who first raised him.  
- **Arms & Hands:** His right arm is reinforced with the spine of a long-dead titan, ending in a gauntleted fist capable of shattering mountains. His left wields the **Evershard Maul**, a warhammer forged from the fossilized skull of a behemoth, each strike unleashing earth-rending shockwaves.  

## **Abilities & Traits**  
### **Titanic Strength**  
Skul’Kruk can tear through fortifications and crush creatures beneath his fossilized fists with ease.  

### **Unbreakable Fossil Form**  
His body is nearly impervious to conventional weapons, as every inch of him is reinforced with the petrified remains of ancient titans.  

### **Earthshaker Stride**  
With each step, the ground trembles. His very presence destabilizes structures and sends enemies sprawling.  

### **Marrowforge Regeneration**  
Damaged bones knit back together over time, his fossilized body reforming from the dust and stone beneath him.  

### **Echo of the Ancient War**  
Weapons wielded against Skul’Kruk sometimes crumble to dust upon impact, as if the past itself denies them the right to strike him.  

### **Wrath of the Titans** *(Recharge 5-6)*  
Skul’Kruk slams his warhammer into the ground, sending a shockwave in a 100-foot radius. Enemies must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take **60 (10d10) thunder damage** and be knocked prone. Structures take double damage.  

## **Temperament & Behavior**  
Skul’Kruk is not mindless, but his intelligence is ancient and alien. He understands war, battle, and destruction—yet he is not inherently cruel. He moves with slow, deliberate purpose, always searching for something long forgotten. Those who challenge him will be met with unstoppable force, but those who understand his purpose may uncover the secrets locked within his fossilized frame.  

## **The Mystery of Skul’Kruk**  
Some believe that deep within his marrow lies the last memories of the fallen titans, fragments of an age before gods and mortals. Others say he is the key to an ancient power, waiting for the right warlord to awaken his full might. Whatever the truth, one thing is certain—Skul’Kruk does not rest, and the battlefield will always call him back.
