# Zephiryx – The Stormwing Titan  
"The skies crackle with fury as its wings rise. The winds obey its call, the storms bow to its might. It does not battle for conquest—it reigns because it was born to rule."

## Origins & Legend  
Zephiryx is an ancient and godlike entity, an avian colossus sculpted from the very essence of storms. It is said that when the first tempests raged across the world, their fury coalesced into a single being—Zephiryx, the Stormwing Titan. It soars the highest reaches of the sky, unseen but ever-watching, a force of nature that intervenes only when the balance of the elements is disturbed.

## Physical Description  
- **Height:** 40 to 50 feet tall when grounded  
- **Wingspan:** Over 200 feet, capable of darkening entire landscapes  
- **Weight:** Unknown; its body is composed of storm-forged feathers and wind-bound bones  
- **Appearance:** A majestic, birdlike titan with sleek, obsidian feathers streaked with arcs of lightning. Its vast wings churn the air into violent tempests, while its talons glow with crackling energy.  
- **Eyes:** Twin orbs of glowing sapphire, reflecting the fury of an endless storm.  
- **Beak & Talons:** Razor-sharp, forged from pure celestial metal, capable of rending mountains.  

## Abilities & Traits  
- **Hurricane Sovereign** – Zephiryx controls the winds at will, summoning devastating tempests.  
- **Tempestuous Flight** – It moves with impossible speed, faster than any mortal eye can follow.  
- **Stormforged Resilience** – Its body is nearly impervious, reinforced by the boundless energy of the sky.  
- **Thunderous Wrath** – When enraged, Zephiryx can call down a barrage of sky-splitting lightning, obliterating entire battlefields.  
- **Celestial Gale** – The mere beat of its wings can send foes hurtling miles away.  

## Temperament & Behavior  
Zephiryx is neither benevolent nor malevolent—it is the storm itself, fierce and unpredictable. It watches the world from above, rarely interfering unless a force dares to challenge the dominion of the skies. Those who seek to harness the power of the heavens may find themselves facing its wrath.

## The Mystery of Zephiryx  
Some claim that Zephiryx is the last of the Celestial Stormborn, titans that once ruled the skies. Others whisper that it is merely a harbinger of something far greater, a vanguard of the endless tempests that will one day reclaim the world. Whatever the truth, none who have seen Zephiryx in its full glory have lived to tell the tale.
