# Context:
Etheria A world reshaped by The Collapse, when the magical creature Irion collided with it, leaving behind massive, near-indestructible scales that define the land. These scales radiate magic, warping the terrain and powering civilizations. Settlements formed around them, using their magic for shelter, tools, and technology.

Magic Cities harness raw magic from cavities in the scales, though tampering with them is forbidden. The largest, Kin'Darei, is a deadly ruin surrounded by creatures and mystery. The Scholar's Rift, hidden behind a selective metaphysical barrier, houses advanced research.

The Five Scales

-   **The Armour of Or** (Largest, white with red spikes) → Beneath the tundra, excavated by dwarves → Home to **The City of Or**.

-   **Batès Lamina** (Smallest, bright red) → Sacred to **Followers of Irion**, built in a lake.

-   **Eldeviérs Shell** (Opal green spire) → Supports **Mohinders**, a suspended city.

-   **Umperas Hull** (Yellow, wall-like) → Natural fortification.

-   **The Asara Plate** (Blue, broken in half) → Creates a scenic route, attracting merchants.

-   **The Orinite Ring** (Black with red lining) → The only floating scale, orbiting Etheria.

Aurorhythmic Resonance Cycle (ARC) Etheria measures time through magical pulses from the scales. The Collapse marks "0 ARC." Resonances shape the timeline, with the Arc of Corruption signifying the decay of once-bountiful scales.
